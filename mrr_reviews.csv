HEX – “Poison In The System: The Demos” CD
If you liked your punk, the UK in the early to mid ’80s was a good place to be. Not only were all kinds of genres flourishing within said rubric, but there was a significant community of like-minded souls, putting on gigs, writing (and distributing) fanzines, (cassette) tape labels, and whatnot. It meant that bands could (and did!) release demos, on cassette, and distribute them far and wide. The anarcho-punk “scene,” spawned by the likes of CRASS and their progeny (SUBHUMANS, CONFLICT, FLUX OF PINK INDIANS, MOB, et al.) were the inspiration and incubator for HEX. Hailing from the Northeast of England, they were part and parcel of the legendary (well, to us folks, anyways) Sunderland Bunker, a venue, and musicians collective. Herein you’ll find four demos tapes (fourteen tracks in all), recorded in 1986 and 1987. A variety of musical styles, evocative of KILLING JOKE, ANTISECT, and the FAMOUS IMPOSTERS grace the demos. It all features the music gifts of Dickie Hammond and Dave Lainey, better known for playing in HDQ and later LEATHERFACE. Really great stuff all round, and some excellent liner notes do a superb job of capturing the sense of community, and possibility that was nurtured by the scene. (Ramsey Kanaan)

G.L.O.S.S. – “Girls Living Outside Society’s Shit” EP
This exists perfectly as a solid hardcore record, nothing necessarily freaky or weird just excellently solid but a thing that makes it stand out (other than the context it exists in) is that you can hear all of the lyrics. No reading along with lyric sheets necessary—somehow, at breakneck speed Sadie manages to enunciate every word. A thing that is always rough to me about hardcore is all the vocals garbled and barked until I kind of just feel like some angry man is yelling at me. And what Sadie is singing about is so integral and important it’s just really fucking cool to just hear every lyric. This record delves into politics in a way that avoids being exclusionary or preachy but instead is filled with rage and love and an overall we’re-in-this-togetherness. It also comes with an excellent zine that furthers the aesthetic and message.

HUNCHES – “You’ll Never Get Away With My Heart / Like I Could Die”
The HUNCHES, if you are unfamiliar, were a Portland punk rock band that’s been dead, dead, dead, for over five years now. They used to do that to their audiences you know, knock ‘em dead. They had this front guy, Chris Gunn, who could make a show feel dangerous in a fulfilling way, like you risked acquiring a truly noble scar encountering a genuinely memorable musical experience. During their existence they were generally categorized as playing “garage punk,” which was how most people used to qualify punk rock that wasn’t a straight carbon copy of 1984 thrash: “garage,” whatever the hell that meant. People are a lot better situated now, it’s come full circle back to a mindset in opposition to hardcore-dogma-adherence, thanks to bands like the HUNCHES getting their retroactive cred. This 7” is their 2001 demo, predating any of their LPs on In The Red. It’s a loud, punishing, art-blues inflected punk rock record with Gunn’s tortured vocals at the front of the mix, and it would sit in your 7” pile of early ’00s-era singles the same way that a FLESHEATERS record parks comfortably with Dangerhouse titles. ’Cause they’re all flying at you from Planet Shit. They may talk different, but they are all talking shit. Buy this or rot in fetid ignorance. (Ryan Wells)

LA MISMA – “Kanizadi” LP
This is so perfect just go buy it now—just do it! LA MISMA from New York are a force to be reckoned with and, after just one 7” and a few demos, this ferocious full-length hurtles through the punk universe like a blazing comet! I can’t single out one song on this record because the consistency and character—the bite!—is found in every song. Each jam packed with pogo power, this is short and fast, heavy and solid, structured but crumbling under the intensity of the execution. A commendable homage to the CRISIS guitar sound, fueled by UK82 punk power and laced with the venom of ’80s Italian punk, but never limited or overshadowed by those influences. The guitar mixes creeping hooks and solos with frontal-attack riffs. The hypnotic bass booms and rumbles with the power of a coming earthquake. The stomping, cymbal-crashing drums are crude and commandeering like a primeval instinct. The vocalist spits, squeals and yelps, all passionate Portuguese delivery and transfixing impressionistic lyrical content. The result is spine-chilling, catchy and driving all at the same time. The production works around the core sound like a Rubik’s cube doing every element justice—the twisting guitar distortion, the bristle and weight of the bass, the dissonance in the vocals, the pitch and punch in the drums. 18 minutes and 53 seconds of white-knuckled, jaw-clenching, hair-raising energy that has my mind and body positively ecstatic. Comes with a 28-page booklet and A2 poster designed by the vocalist. For fans of: good fucking music! Exceptional! (Lydia A)

EBENEZER AND THE BLUDGEONS – “Peer Pressure” EP
Looky what I win this month! No one coulda guessed these OG Baltimore KBD punkers were such the lyrical geniuses, but there’s no doubt after any spin of this classique 1978 four-songer. I still remember first dropping the needle after coughing up some substantial lunch money in the ’90s. Side A doesn’t really do much bludgeoning, ’cept with the inescapable “al-bi-no” chorus of “Gerti,” but the B-side is the absolute apex of bar band punk. Ooh, the controversy of “Weekend Nazi,” only to be topped with the inexplicable punk paradox of “Oh! I Love This Weather” with one of the least climactic punk choruses ever. How can something that sucks so hard manage to also be the greatest thing ever?! I’m proud to be an American. (Graham Booth)

EUTANASIA – “Sentimiento de Agitación” LP 
Here is the first vinyl rendition of a classic Peruvian punk tape recorded in 1990. Somewhere at the intersection of the RAMONES and RIP, EUTANASIA distills punk into its raw rock material essentials: catchy, pogo-friendly, yet serious and angry punk. Their commitment to carrying the torch of local underground rock is demonstrated by the covers of both LOS SAICOS “Demolición” and LEUSEMIA. Informative insert made for English speakers outlines the challenges of playing underground music during turbulent times. While your country is busy waging a bloody war between Maoists and a brutal state, one option is to go on creating something amidst the wreckage. This record is that plebian answer to the senseless violence. Forming in 1986, those members who stuck it out in Lima recorded this record in 1990, and then they too fled the country. Crucial recording for Peruvian punk history and a must have for anyone even remotely interested in Latin American punk. (Lena T)

BIKINI KILL – “Revolution Girl Style Now” LP
BIKINI KILL was my gateway band into DIY punk. I got into them when the first 12” came out, and then the year after they toured the UK with HUGGY BEAR, which was a life-changing experience for fourteen-year-old me. The fact that I have never heard these recordings at all is sort of funny to me now—I was such a maniac fan as a teen and I don’t get why I didn’t try and track this tape down! It’s so fucking incredible! This beautifully done reissue has the songs from their infamous demo and you can clearly see why this recording enabled BIKINI KILL to tour extensively without a record, exactly how they got so much notice/press in the pre-internet age. It’s simply incendiary. Like the Situationist and S.C.U.M. manifestos cut up with added teen girl diary fire. The music sounds eternal yet fresh, referencing early CA punk sounds—the AVENGERS, SIN 34, BLACK FLAG with added X-RAY SPEX. There are a million bands that pay homage to such possibilities and don’t get close to what this band achieve. I mean, it seems almost pointless to write about BIKINI KILL sounds. They are pretty much the MINOR THREAT of the ’90s, a band that transcended genre and had a global reach because of the true and total power and strength of their sound and message. They were a band that made girls and queers want to create their own version of the punk rock ideal, reaching lonely kids in isolated communities that maybe didn’t know about DIY punk. They were charismatic and cool, and listening to this it’s obvious why they were the catalyst for a new feminist punk reality. Kathleen’s voice sounds absolutely incredible, a totally incandescent force of power and fire. This may be the best recording of it I have heard, one that fully demonstrates how this band burned through the world and took over hearts and minds…It just sounds so good! There are two songs that made it onto vinyl back then as compilation tracks (on Give Me Back and one of the Yo Yo comps—and maybe a KRS comp too?!), plus demo versions of some classic songs from the split LP and the first 12” and three insane unreleased songs, which either didn’t fit on the demo tape, or were rejected for sounding unlike the other songs, depending on what you read. It’s really cool listening to these songs in light of what BIKINI KILL became. They very much situate the band’s sound in the context of the Pacific Northwest, providing an idea of them potentially being an almost FLIPPER-esque grunge group! The group love for BABES IN TOYLAND guitar tricks is real…At any rate it’s clear this LP is a must have for all punks, so grab one and then start your own feminist punk action force. This record is an instruction sheet not a rulebook! Make your own. (Layla Gibbon)

AYE NAKO – “The Blackest Eye” 12”
Brooklyn’s AYE NAKO are back with their first release since their 2013 debut LP Unleash Yourself. I know that the band wanted to change their sound after that LP in an attempt to distance themselves from the “pop punk” label and even went as far as talking about releasing a hardcore EP. (I’d love to hear that since “Good Grief” from their demo is still one of my favorite songs of theirs). Instead of hardcore, they went in a completely different direction and delivered a lush, dense, guitar heavy, indie-shitstorm (that’s good) that recalls some of the melodic sensibilities of the best SUPERCHUNK stuff and the guitar noodle-ry (that’s a word) of TED LEO. I don’t use these band names to imply that they’re using these well-worn roadways as a blueprint. I use them as a signifier that AYE NAKO knows their history, they know what the fuck they’re doing and they build on those who have come before them to create their own new beast that is theirs to tame (or not tame) as they see fit. The whole presentation feels like a step up from the band’s previous record, which was no slouch but had moments that felt rushed or not quite fully-realized. There’s no wasted space here. The lyrics dig deep into thoughts on sexual abuse, race, the quagmire of eternal self-doubt, the fucking total-realness of never-ending white supremacy and the insidious ways that it continues to sustain itself. In a music scene that cannot stop focusing on white skin and cis-gender bodies, this record is unapologetically queer, defiant and brown. Plus, it has a lot of sweet hooks. All of these things are important. All of these things are good. I can’t wait to hear what they create next. (Greg Harvester)

MERCENÁRIAS – “Demo 1983” EP
There is probably no band like MERCENÁRIAS. This 3/4 femme Brazilian band, better known for their late ’80s post-punk repertoire, made an extraordinary first recording that seems out of time and place. Totally weird, awesome, and fierce: peculiar gruff vocals that predate grindcore layered over angular choppy rhythms making it sound like someone took a chainsaw to the rock song and assembled the hacked up pieces back together with lots of sharp edges sticking out all over the place. They were definitely ahead of their time with irreverent and unapologetic lyrics taking a shit all over patriarchy and scandalizing audiences (the song “Honra” never made it onto their recordings until now). The story in the booklet of sending a talent scout running after hearing one of their songs reminds me of the philosophy of Spain’s VULPESS, active around the same time, who got a TV program shut down in Spain for performing a song called “I Like Being a Slut.” Nice packaging with a semi-bilingual booklet in English and Portuguese containing old flyers, pictures, and lyrics. This is an important piece of Brazilian punk history and crucial international punk artifact with a renewed relevance in 2015. (Lena T)

DAN MELCHIOR’S BROKE REVIEW – “Lords Of The Manor” LP
The welcome return of DAN MELCHIOR’S BROKE REVUE after a ten-year hiatus (although Melchior himself has been anything but idle, cranking out scores of releases in the meantime). This new one reflects a slight change in tone since Dan relocated permanently to the USA. Musically loose and sprawling (only seven tracks spread out over the two sides of this album), vocally deadpan and sardonic. Instrumentation and arrangements are still pretty bare-bones: the rhythm section and keyboards lock into a repetitive groove while the guitar skitters, wails, and scratches over the top. If they discovered Neolithic standing stones on the outskirts of the Medway towns this HAWKWIND meets HEADCOATS sound would be perfect for the first solstice party. (Allen McNaughton)

DISCLOSE – “Yesterday’s Fairytale, Tomorrow’s Nightmare” LP
This is a monumental record, even without considering its place as the final DISCLOSE LP released before Kawakami’s passing in 2007. His death casts an enduring pall, particularly evident here in the new liner notes from Stuart Schrader. While Schrader primarily writes about the ill-fated DISCLOSE / FRAMTID tour, it is a far more insightful, nuanced and touching read than that might seem. Neither romantic nor cynical, the tone is simply reflective and personal: here are his perceptions of Kawakami’s experience in the US, not a verdict but a single opinion. The epilogue of the story, over a decade later, remains ambivalent. Kawakami, despite his legacy, was still a human being irreducible to the mythos that lives on after him. The continued care and commitment shown by those that knew him and called him “friend” are a welcome palliative, showing a more grounded context to the DISCLOSE legend. In that respect, the royalties from this reissue are going to Kawakami’s mother. Of course, for the vast majority of listeners, as Schrader is mindful to point out, the context is far less immediately relevant than the record itself. For those who ignore or simplify DISCLOSE as just some DISCHARGE-worship: you are missing the forest for the trees because these trees look like some other damn trees you saw in a different fucking forest. It’s just not that simple, and especially not with this record. Schrader’s track-by-track notes are much more compelling and attentive than anything I can comparably muster, so I won’t attempt too much here. Yesterday’s Fairytale is the pinnacle of “Disbones”-era DISCLOSE: fuzzed-out D-beat with increasingly more metallic influence in the guitar riffs. Without forsaking any of the raw energy, this style set loose the true hypnotic potential of the unrelenting beat that found its logical conclusion in the closing track “Wardead,” a nearly ten-minute opus of swirling chaos and perpetual solos; a psychedelic disengagement with time, a sonic inertial assault that is simultaneously as stupefying as it is doggedly transcendent. Noise, not music. Best listened to with a foggy brain. RIP Kawakami, Kawakami forever. (Shit Zoo)

A Wailing Of A Town: An Oral History of Early San Pedro Punk and More
Craig Ibarra
344 pgs • $20
End Fwy Press
endfwypress.bigcartel.com
Yet another punk related oral history. Can the collective punk bookshelves take another addition to the seeming endless array of “I was there” sprawl? Has punk overtaken the hippie nostalgia frenzy? The answer to both of those questions is yes! I would put this book up with Lexicon Devil, another oral history about SoCal punk, as one of the best encapsulations of the mechanics, dysfunctions and excitements of a punk scene I have read. A Wailing of a Town shows the other side of the coin. The kids who didn’t run away to Hollywood, but rather stayed in their working class Southern California harbor town and made their own music and constructed their own idea of punk and community out of what they had. Lexicon Devil was ostensibly a biography of Darby Crash, but it somehow felt more like Crash was the fulcrum for a sprawling documentary report on the growth, power and dysfunctions of LA punk. This book is an oral history of San Pedro punk, and D. Boon, the city’s favorite son, ends up being the heart and soul of the narrative. Where previously published punk oral histories have put across the hip/cool actions of the cognoscenti (Please Kill Me, We Got the Neutron Bomb, etc.), this one really communicates the true inspiring and powerful force that is getting caught up in underground DIY and making something on your own terms.
While I was reading this someone asked me if it was “a Minutemen bio”—since clearly nothing else of note happened in Pedro punk in this person’s mind! One of the cooler aspects of the book is that while the Minutemen rightfully get a huge chunk of the chapters devoted to their sound and ideas, the other people who shaped a scene are given as much weight, from supportive non-musical punkers who were there to witness events or took on the background shitwork through to the wild performance artists. You really get a sense of how the San Pedro take on punk emerged from the town and how it was shaped by the different economic and geographic realities. The different voices and perspectives in the book—the macho nihilistic surf jocks, the feminist working class women of color—all give this work a true feeling of representation, and make it a fun and wild read.
The fact that the Minutemen were one of the guiding forces of the Pedro punks meant that people looked at them as examples, and as a result started their own weird bands and made their own record labels that only put out their friends’ weird and/or generic bands. It was a constructive and encouraging scene, despite endless harassment from cops and jocks and angry anti-punk locals. The feeling that you get from listening to the Minutemen, the rough and tumble warmth in with the cold hard truth, really reflects the scene that they came up through and helped invent. On the evidence of this book, the creative, expressive and radical power embodied by their sound, from the crazed inventive music through to the impassioned lyrics, the needs of the working class and the power of Coltrane are endorsed with equal authority, shaped the San Pedro punk idea as one quite distinct from other Southern Californian scenes. Speaking of which, the chapters on Saccharine Trust are easily worth the price of admission. Paganicons is one of the wildest and most interesting LPs SST ever released, and despite the fact that many punks now revere Saccharine Trust, it still feels like they somehow haven’t gotten their due. It was really inspiring and sometimes hilarious reading about how they formed and the ideas behind the songs, the evolution of the band and their disparate poetic, Dada, No Wave and be-bop based influences.
Punk is a visual and visceral culture, and this book does a great job of putting across the aesthetics, the sights, scents and ideas of the random assortment of people that were drawn to it. The flyers, the fanzines, the insane apartments that intentionally resembled surrealist hamster cages…They had shows in the infamous repurposed Church featured in Decline of Western Civilization I, a German themed village hall that sounded like a weird Euro-Tiki bar-like space complete with a rotten waterfall and ski lodge like ambiance, a repurposed theater which also had avant-garde dance classes. You get a sense of the danger from violent audience members imported from Orange County and aggressive anti-punk locals and of course, the cops, all of which is such a part of the narrative of Southern California punk. You also get a sense of the creativity and resourcefulness of the Pedro punkers in figuring out how to work around all that aggression and darkness and make a scene work.
This book is one of the best accounts of punk I have read, the interviews and excerpts are exhaustive and cover the nihilistic and constructive, the intoxicating and the mundane. Its somewhat homespun aesthetic is misleading; this book was masterfully edited by Craig Ibarra. So many perspectives and takes on different events weave together to create a powerful, emotional narrative, it was an unputdownable ride—I read this from cover to cover in a mad consuming frenzy, but had to leave the last few chapters, the ones about D. Boon’s death, to read when I was alone at home, as I knew it would be devastating. It was. Reader, I wept. Unlike most artifacts from the past where it seems like all the cool stuff happened without you, in some other untouchable dimension, A Wailing of a Town ultimately makes you want to create something new and worthy in your own town and scene.

CONFLICT – “Last Hour” LP
If there were any justice in this world, punks would think Tucson, Arizona, not London, England, when they heard the name CONFLICT. The superior American band released a demo tape and a single LP in the early ’80s and the record gets the reissue treatment here, complete with a deluxe 40-page booklet. This is absolutely essential for all fans of classic USHC—think the thrash of early TSOL with intelligible MacKaye-esque vocals overtop, except now Ian’s called Karen and she’s a queer Japanese-American woman singing about things a hell of a lot more important and interesting than straightedge and post-adolescent disaffection. Not that there’s anything wrong with anthems about being merely out of step—some of the greatest punk songs ever written are about nothing more than that!—but at a time when being a hardcore band in the United States meant being anti-Reagan and anti-establishment seemingly by default, the political specificity of Karen’s vitriol must have been refreshing. She wrote lyrics about human trafficking, nuclear war, femicide, and her lived experiences as a psychiatric nurse, a woman, and a minority, always direct and never preachy. The flyer reproductions in the enclosed glossy booklet reveal that CONFLICT played with everybody who came through Tucson—BLACK FLAG, HÜSKER DÜ, DIE KREUZEN, DEAD KENNEDYS, MINOR THREAT, DOA, CRUCIFUCKS, MEAT PUPPETS, the GUN CLUB, and TOXIC REASONS, to name just a few. This group should be a household name like the rest of them, but as we all know, history is rarely just. Also reproduced are two interviews with the group from the archives of the greatest punk fanzine on the planet (ahem), one done in their heyday and the other ten years after their dissolution, conducted by the late great Lance Hahn. Comes with a lyric sheet and photo insert. Get it. (GA)"

NEGATIVE SCANNER – LP
The brilliant promise of that first NEGATIVE SCANNER single was the way it oscillated between moody, off-kilter rhythmic trance and classic “Moon Over Marin”-style hookiness, and I guess they could have gone either way with their full-length. It seems like they mostly stuck with the latter, which was the one disappointment in my first go-around with this record. Maybe I’m just more rhythmically inclined, so don’t let my personal temperament steer you away. If anyone ever tells you that Chicago is a zero-tracks kind of town (everyone’s an expert since Martin moved away from the MRR compound), you can tune them in to “Would You Rather” (it’s incredible) or “Ivy League Asshole” after you name-check the EFFIGIES. Something about the way the guitarists play here is really forcing me to make my first WIPERS comparison in my career as an MRR reviewer (I was hoping to make it at least ten issues before this happened). Specifically it reminds of that eerie Youth of America-era open-chord type of sound, an under-tapped vein of inspiration. The beginning of “Forget It” has this incessant chime that gets cut through by an underlying guitar line that sounds like a cello or something. The winding and cresting surf guitar riff that opens up “Saturday Night and Sunday Morning” is just sick; it’s raw, it’s classic. One thing really ties it together here: Rebecca Valeriano-Flores is an utterly devastating lyricist with a powerfully understated delivery, a tuff singer. All you other so-called songsmiths out there: step it up. More and more uncanny details come up as I spend more time with these songs. This one is either a winter record dropped in the wrong time of year or a summer record for that point late at night in a hot city when you realize you can’t stand it outside any longer. Backed.

REATARDS – “Grown Up, Fucked Up” LP
When this record was originally issued by Empty Records back in 1999, it felt like the REATARDS had already been around for a decade, at least (their first single is from ’97). The band seemed to jump into existence already in “mature phase,” which is the benefit of having a true maniac creative like Jay crafting your songs. It’s great to now slide back into the shitty, shitty, shitty, shitty, shitty, shitty pile of emotional bile that the best REATARDS tracks evoke, and realize the ability it confers, upon first needle drop, to discern fake punk from the real thing. It’s always going to be present on this record, the best full-length Jay Reatard ever pulled off. So, it still holds up as one of the ten best punk LPs of the decade, and the best ’90s party bummer LP I own outside of the BAD TIMES LP, and hey! Look who’s all over that fucker too. (Ryan Wells)

HAPPY? – “Anger” EP 
This felt vaguely familiar upon first listen. That feeling turned into deja vu and I had no idea why. The previous day I had been thinking about leaving San Francisco after more than a quarter of a century and was going over all the wonderful Bay Area bands I had seen over the years and thinking back to the early days of powerviolence. Ah ha! Got it! This 7” was familiar because I had heard the vocalist many times before. HAPPY? was a Redwood City, CA band that I don’t remember ever releasing anything or playing out much. These tracks were recorded back in 1993 and the band contains members that went on to play in bands such as SPAZZ, FUNERAL SHOCK, BUG PEDALS, CANDY MUSCLE, and POWER PELLUT along with a few others. What you get is raw hardcore that is full of energy. It sounds like it was recorded live in a garage and the songs are sort of intentionally sloppy. These tracks were originally available on a cassette. “Biggot” is a bit faster and tighter and I love the vocals. This is a great historical release if you’re interested in some fast hardcore with vague sounds of the things to come from Redwood City. Think of it as a precursor to powerviolence. (Mike Howes)

NERVOSAS – LP
Oh my fucking god, I wish this record had a lyric sheet! NERVOSAS returns with the always-dreaded second LP and manages to not blow it. You can chalk this success up to solid songwriting, over the top musicianship from every member and a truckload of energy in every song. They do that dark punk / chorus pedal / WIPERS-influenced thing super well…but don’t call it goth! They manage to make every song interesting and memorable. I’ve always thought that this band was excellent live, but left something to be desired when it came to their recordings, but this LP has me changing my tune. If you’re feeling fatigued from the current onslaught of dark punk that might as well be lumped in with JOY DIVISION and wanna just get back to losing your mind to sick ass punk bands, you’ll wanna track down this LP. No weak moments. All tracks. Plus, their drummer used to play in GAUNT sometimes and he’s probably one of the best drummers in punk today. (Greg Harvester)

BASEMENT BENDERS – “Native Tongues” EP
Sometimes when you hear that a handful of your favorite music-makers are joining hands and starting a new band it turns into exactly what you wanted to hear and it’s fucking fantastic. Sometimes, as we all know, it’s embarrassing and unspeakably bad. This record is great! Sorry for the scare. This has members of SEXY, HIDDEN SPOTS, THIS BIKE IS A PIPE BOMB, TULSA, FUTURE VIRGINS and (as you probably guessed) about a thousand other amazing bands from Chattanooga and Asheville. For the abundant haters of region rock around here, I think this is a good spot to try to get your head out of your ass. For the lovers of the genre, well, you probably ordered this EP long ago. I heard about this band and I checked out the demo on that little internet thing that everyone is doing. To be honest, I just didn’t get the hype. I thought maybe I was biased and maybe butt-hurt and bitter, but these re-workings are really fucking great. Angry, pretty, rough, tight, and well thought-out.

C.C.T.V – “Quiet” EP
The coolest record of the year so far at least to these ears, total nervous frantic post-punk created in the furtive fertile NW Indiana scenery…The songs are tightly wound fraught invocations of the indignities of modern life, anxiety and paranoia, everything sounds like it was recorded on a boombox at the wrong speed adding to the strange feeling of otherworldliness, like walking through a dead mall full of fake plants and broken ideas. It’s perfectly retro, really sounds like a recently excavated secret basement from the 1979 New Wave/punk collision, but it’s from now, and is fresh yet eternal. The sputtering drums and stumbling bass with that sick dollar store guitar sound, while the coolest vocalist lists her demands and concerns. It’s just so fuckin rad, like SU TISSUE fronting DEVO at their most hardcore…I think it sold out, but a repress is on the way. (Layla Gibbon)

92 – “Cenzura/Cukrarnar”
The travel back in time continues! Next stop: Ljubljana, Slovenia circa 1978. Like many bands from former Yugoslavia, 92—who get their name from the police’s phone number, the equivalent to 911 in the US—fuse new wave sounds with reconstructed regional and traditional musical elements, all filtered through punk with a keyboard twist. 92 were informed by, but not dependent on or limited to, bands such as the CLASH, SEX PISTOLS and STONES, and concepts such as nihilism, Dadaism and social critique. Their logo of the number 92 inside a triangle charms and perplexes me despite its simplicity. This results in upbeat tracks with layers of choppy and grazing guitars, dancey drums alongside swelling bass, and soulful, raw organ riffs haunting the whole thing. The lyrics are critical and sharp. “Cukrarnar” (“Sugar Works Man”) tells the story of a “raged vagrant on the street […], he’s dirty and full of trash, in sugar works every night he spends, but then he wakes up on the bench.” “Cenzura,” which discusses the issue of state censorship, is slightly darker, with its dense opening riff and staccato keyboards. “Basically you corrected everything on your own.” The keys are wonderfully expressive, tying this whole concept together in a unique manner; at times sounding almost like a child’s melodica, at others more like a breezy church organ, or carrying the frenetic beat in an almost accordion-at-the-fair fashion. Their collected works LP, which was released in 2013 also by NE! Records and reviewed in these pages, is definitely worth checking out if you have an interest in early European punk, but this 45 works as an excellent introduction to this extraordinary band. Two tracks that are equal parts vibrant demonstration as they are creative exuberance. As always, comes in a beautiful packaging, with lots of pictures and translated lyrics. Check out their interview in MRR #378 and hvala NE! Records for doing such a great job! (Lydiya)

ANDY HUMAN AND THE REPTOIDS — LP
“Reptoid Rock Revenge” is the motto on the collage/lyric sheet. How and by whom were they slighted? The answers may be in Fortean Times rather than these pages. I, however, can tell you that so much of what makes this record great could have gone terribly in lesser hands: saxophones, synthesizers, rhyming “insides” with “intestines”. It all comes together in the hands of ANDY HUMAN, rocker and composer. Some tracks toe the line of Boogaloo palatability, but there’s an attention to detail and careful application of sheer noise all over here, the watermark of a dedicated stylist. The production here is polished enough to let the static and atonal saxophone-wailing stand out. High fidelity recording works to a band’s favor for once. Then again I seriously think the internet-using public would flip out if this was recorded on a Tascam 414 and if everyone in the band was 5-10 years younger. Perhaps the world will appreciate this record after all, though we know too well how cruel America’s tastes and ultimate fate can be. But seek out “I Got Soul” if you need a sample; rarely since Rock’n’Roll Animal have punk desperation and glam virtuosity come together in such a frothy eruption. I’d buy seven copies of this record if I could afford it, but I can’t. Anyway, this record is one of the two most assertive statements on having no money in the city to come in this month. Some react to late capitalism in urban America by withdrawing; some stick around to try their hand at outplaying, outsmarting, and outlasting the suddenly very late night. Hand them the keys to the studio. (Eli Wald)

NO FORM – 12”
I must sound like some kind of sycophantic anglophile the way I’ve been raving about UK hardcore lately, but something is really happening over there. Apparently this thing that is happening is not limited to any particular major city, but is happening all over the island. I have been told NO FORM are from up north and maybe the cover photo is indicative of exactly where. Either way, this is a band after my own heart. I’ve seen reference made to certain hardcore bands alongside certain early industrial / post-punk bands I hold in the highest esteem, but really all you need to know is that this record is a complete fucking beast. The A-side contains four quick stompers accented by noisy effect-laden guitars and off-kilter rhythms while the flip is a side-length filth-dirge that really hits the proverbial spot. Just a two-note bass plod accompanied by manic guitars, pounding drums, cavernous rantings, and a mutilated saxophone. This is not for everyone, but those who are prepared to dare will be rewarded with endless delights. (Jon Kortland)

BLITZKRIEG – “Apel” EP
Croatia, our distant love affair continues! Underrated, shambolic protest punk from Zagreb. BLITZKRIEG formed in 1984, then a year later recorded their four-track demo in two days. All four are on this nice slab of wax, and fuck if they aren’t all really good. The recital intro to “Apel” (“Appeal”) from the bleach-blonde, leather-clad singer is giving me chills—it’s annoyed and determined and snarky and passionate. “This is an appeal to reality.” A rockin’ riff rolls in and the gritty mid-tempo has me sucked in. The singer is kind of dragging his voice, sniggering between lyrics, while the guitars are kind falling apart in a warm wave of basement fuzz. “Tko je kriv?” (“Who is to blame?”) is a certified jammer, with its chopped up guitars and impatient vocals: “Who is to blame for the quiet agony of society?” All tracks have been remastered but I enjoy the graininess to this recording; it’s so analog and intimate, it adds character and depth, of which they already have ample. Comes with translated lyrics and cool pictures—some seminal Yugo punk! (Lydiya)

POWER MASTERS — “Home of the Grave” LP
This month’s Mystery Record: no one knows when it got here, no one knows who assigned it, and even midway through listening to it I have no idea what it sounds like. Maybe a David Yow impersonator fronting the bar band from “Roadhouse”? I haven’t seen that film with the sound on in a while, but imagine actually that there are two bands on opposite sides of the room trying to play the same song from memory after not practicing for six months. That’s not meant to be a diss. There is definitely a laid back, behind the groove feel that they’re going for here. Equal parts swagger and self-awareness were poured into this particular rum drink. I don’t know if anyone should be allowed to name a song “Come On Feel This Noise”, but POWER MASTERS certainly did. It has a few cool PENTAGRAM as played by thirteen year-old garage band style riffs, linked by “Shreds”-vid quality interludes (that’s a compliment). I feel like this recording doesn’t capture the vocalist’s delivery as well as it could though. He can manage the swing between atonal deadpan and desperate howl well enough, but some lines kind of fall flat. No moments are really going to get stuck in my head here, but that’s probably not the point. I don’t know if there’s a one big track here that’s going to make my ultimate drinking-in-a-parked-minivan-outside-the-club-after-losing-the-keys mixtape (strictly the EXECUTE and TANK), but a few are weird, loose, and heavy enough to plead their case. I do kind of want to see this band live now that I know they exist, so if I ever swing by Providence I will bring a jug of Malibu just in case. (Eli Wald)

BROKEN TALENT – “Rules No One” LP
Fuckin’ sick! Most KBD fans I know have a real soft spot for Florida’s BROKEN TALENT, even tho their classic Blood Slut 7” EP came out in 1984, a full two years after the industry standard KBD cut-off of 1982. It’s gotta be one helluva classic to get KBD golems to pay more than $40 for a 7” EP from 1984 this side of the QUEERS. Imagine my shock to discover there’s a whole fuckin’ LP worth of BROKEN TALENT material. Well, I guess if I was a lil’ more in tune with my mid ’80s punk cassette game, I’d know the BROKEN TALENT “album” came out in 1985 on their own TPOS label. Oh well. This thing is sick, disaffected punk rock, just rough enough to keep the hardcores interested, with enough tuneful hooks to get stuck in the punks’ heads, in the same way that early RED CROSS (O.C.) was the best band that ever existed. Wish the cover art was a little less abstract, I’m worried some people who really need to hear this won’t! (Graham Booth)

VIOLENCE CREEPS – “I’m Broke/Gridlock” flexi
         “I’m Broke” is one of those songs that is so immediately catchy, punk and destroyed that I thought it was a cover song. The band lurches through two chords while their singer Amber screams her fucking head off about all the shit she can’t afford. The band ramps up their energy through the two paltry minutes of this ripper until it’s on the verge of falling apart. It has an instantly classic sound that feels pure and raw in all the best ways. Without a doubt, it’s easily one of top five favorite songs of the year. That’s a hard act to follow, but “Gridlock” is also a ripper about being stuck in traffic. VIOLENCE CREEPS is lurchy, slow, destructive, pissed-the-fuck-off and perfectly raw. The soundtrack to losing your goddamn mind. This flexi (the worst format, my only complaint) comes with issue #16 of Degenerate magazine. (Greg Harvester)

DEGENERATE FLEXI by Violence Creeps
VIOLENCE CREEPS – “On My Turf” EP
I don’t know what to tell you. Yesterday I woke up, ate a shitty fucking West Coast bagel (masochism rears its ugly head), sat down at this computer and didn’t stand up except to piss and refill my coffee for thirteen or so hours. This music is the soundtrack to that. Today I went to my low-paying job and my boss bought me lunch at the organic taqueria that is probably owned by white people and there was some sort of Instagram photoshoot going on involving fish tacos and a hot pink longboard and this was the soundtrack to that. Tomorrow I have to get up at 5:00 a.m. and get on a plane to Minneapolis to see my family which will be nice but we will probably get in a fight over my new finger tattoo and someone will get too drunk at dinner and we’ll all feel terrible about it but it will also be kind of funny and this will be the soundtrack to that. Last night I had an unending stream of maddening interactions with a series of punishers and this was literally the soundtrack to that. It was the record release show for this fine platter in the basement of a completely mystifying club and if you live in the Bay Area and you weren’t in attendance, you’re a poseur and a loser and an idiot. Too strong? I don’t care. Fuck you. This is the best band in the Bay Area. They make me wanna flip over tables and punch people in the face, but they also make me laugh like a maniac and wanna hang out and make weird art with my friends. It’s funny, it’s intelligent, it’s infectious and instantly classic. Watch the music video for “On My Turf.” You’ll get it, if you’ve got eyes and ears and a semi-functioning brain. Watch it. Now. Do you get it? Who needs John Brannon when you have Amber? There’s acoustic guitar and sax freakout and bass skronk and slow FLIPPER-esque sludge but also good old fashioned ’core and hooks for days. (“Drop Out,” you’re moshing!) This is a band that is getting better with every release and this record finds them at the peak of their powers, powers that don’t look quite like anything else out there. For fans of the “catchy-but-weird” hardcore du jour:if you like it tougher, meaner, smarter, catchier, more depraved—you’re a punk, right? So the answer is yes, right?—get this. Wake up, sheeple.

NO – “Treating People Like They Don’t Exist” MLP
These Londoners have really outdone themselves this time. While I whole-heartedly enjoyed the self-titled 12” on Static Shock, this record is definitely the next level. The recording here is much akin to “the lunatic ravings of a one-off man-mental!” Somehow the guitar has this brittle clean tone clarity while still being completely overdriven. The bass and drums are heavier than an anvil dropped onto a baby grand and still retain precision and punchiness. On top of all that is this completely feral, animalistic, snarling vocal. All of this alone would make a good record, but it is the totally inventive songwriting that makes this a great record. One more reason UK hardcore is back on the map…with a vengeance. Do yourself and your neighbors a favor. (Jon Kortland)"

DVA MINUTA MRŽNE – “Došao Je Kraj” EP
Cream of the crop Serbian punk from 1984 with a strong Oi! influence. No Plan records has done us a fine service here, as this EP was originally released in an unsatisfactory amount of 100 copies back in ’95, and most online sellers seemingly wouldn’t let a copy go for less than a couple hundred bucks (trust me, I’ve been after a copy for years!) These four cuts are full-sounding, burly, and gruff punk with huge infectious choruses and melodic guitar leads. Imagine classics like BLITZ and CAMERA SILENS but with that unmistakable Balkan flair. Timeless material, perfect for dancing, singing along, and will easily stand out from the pack on your next mixtape. I seriously can’t recommend this (and their other EP on No Plan) enough!

DOWNTOWN BOYS – “Full Communism” LP
This is a seamless melding of so many punk touchstones. It’s X-RAY SPEX raised on hardcore and these saxophones (double fucking saxophones!) sound so LORA LOGIC and the rage in every moment is palpable and focused. It’s cathartic and faces the worst a capitalist, racist, sexist, classist (and so on) society can shit onto the world and finds joy in the action of confrontation and discussion and standing up for shit. The world is bleak and the subject matter of these songs is bleak but this record definitely isn’t bleak. This manages to be triumphant without being anthemic and heavily opinionated without being preachy. The lyrics fluctuate between Spanish and English, there are moments that speed up to breakneck paces and then moments that have enough space to dance in, cherry-picking the best sounds of punk and blending them into something purely exciting. This record is incredibly fucking good, an undeniably perfect punk record. (Marissa Magic)

TRAGIEDIA – “Punk ’Til Destruction” LP
There’s a lot to be excited about with regards to punk in the 2010s, the seemingly endless flood of high-quality reissues being very high on that list. TRAGIEDA’s demos have been circulating among dedicated tape traders for decades, but until now these songs are probably best known via the kind of lackluster POST REGIMENT tribute LP from ’99. Now, finally, we have a quality release of the original material and it’s fucking blazing. Unlike a lot of Polish punk bands which embraced genre-hopping experimentation, this is just straight-up hardcore punk, driven by hard-hitting 1-2 drums, buzzsaw guitars, and pissed-off vocals. The gritty recording quality is preserved in the best possible way, adding a layer of grime to the band’s violent, ugly hardcore attack. It’s hard to articulate just how vital and fucking pissed-off this music is. Even divorced from the context in which it was made this is some of the angriest punk I’ve ever heard, in both presentation and lyrics. You can’t listen to songs like “Krowy” or “Brak Slow” or “Cisza” and feel good about yourself or the state of the world around you—then you look at the lyrics and you just want to die. I wish that this had gotten the super-swank reissue treatment, with a fat booklet of photos and band history and such, but here you get the music and the words and that’s all you really need. If you buy one record based on MRR reviews this month, make it this one. Absolutely essential and long, long overdue. (Andrew Underwood)

GAS CHAMBER – “Stained Hands” EP
Though I must confess that I’ve personally slept on them for far too long, these progressive Buffalo punkers have been turning a lot of heads recently (pun intended) with their left-field take on hardcore, and this record makes it all too easy to see why. The titular track starts out as a meandering, sunbaked slice of anarcho-psych, taking its sweet time before cascading into a cacophonous whirl that is at once ripping and dreamy. The B-side is just a fierce, with desert vibes that would make the MEAT PUPPETS proud, and they even manage to pull off an instrumental track on a hardcore 7”! Getting more mileage out of a chorus pedal than just about any band in contemporary punk (R.I.P. LIFEFORM), I could see this getting filed under the ever-so-saturated banner of “melodic crust,” but this is simply too fuckin’ weird to squeeze into any generic microniche. Cheers to GAS CHAMBER and SPHC for another solid fuck off to hardcore conformity. (Will Blomquist)

BLACK TIME – “Aerial Gobs of Love” LP
All hail BLACK TIME, architects of the brutal and arcane…Transporting the listener to the collapsing concrete shopping centers of London, in which girls and boys as informed as much by the Medway Sound as the Situationist ideal hack out a new / old existence in the ashes of commerce. What other group could summon thoughts of HUGGY BEAR, SWELL MAPS, early Michigan garage sounds, Musique Concrète, girls in bootleg Mary Quant / Bridget Riley get ups reading Sheila Delaney’s teenage works…BLACK TIME is the way and the truth. The sound of irate bedroom masterworks—when Lemmy Caution shouts he’s got no expectations you can feel that tool Jagger’s smug sprawl of expectations slowly eating away at the earth… Janey Too-bad’s voice on the title track makes me wanna grab a Silvertone and join the WHAT FOUR (or the MOD 4). Anyway this is a piercing, shambling, devastating view into two years of bedroom recordings by London’s only garage band (who no longer exist, but word on the street is the MIDNIGHT MINES is a new and related endeavor).

MOSKWA – “Nigdy!” LP
I couldn’t be happier holding this long overdue reissue of MOSKWA’s awesome 1986 cassette. This recording sees them at their most ferocious. Blazing tempos and high-pitched and insane sounding guitars give MOSKWA a sound of their own among other Polish punk heroes like DEZERTER, TZN XENNA, POST REGIMENT, and REJESTRACJA. The chord progressions and snarled vocal melodies on here indicate a strong talent for songwriting. The recording is so hot and raw and grips me in such a unique way. The default pace is so fast and furious, but then these strong mid-paced songs like “Za Kratami” and “Problem” really stand out as the best. This high-quality reish comes with a nice looking booklet containing translated lyrics and lots of great photos of these guys and their big hair. You don’t need every one of those gazillion reissues of every obscure ’80s punk release, but you really do need this one. (Matt Badenhop)

FLESH WORLD — “The Wild Animals in My Life” LP
I should probably disclose that FLESH WORLD might have already been my favorite San Francisco band before I heard this record. So I may be going into this review a little biased. But who among us wouldn’t be? Even you, reader, have probably been acquainted with them already, by last month’s interview in this magazine for instance, or maybe through their frequent appearances in monthly and yearly top-ten lists here. For the new record I would have been perfectly satisfied with eight tracks that sounded like their debut 12”, but they’ve taken steps to change things up here. For one, guitarist Scott Moore adds some synth textures to a few songs here, which within the scope of Don Pyle’s production is perfectly subtle. If you have a friend who decries the presence of any synthesizer as New Wave and False, don’t tell them; they may not even notice. If you’re less insecure in your punk predilections, you may appreciate the oscillation between the desperate drive of “To Lose Me” and the WAKE-like textures of the title track. Everything you love about FLESH WORLD is here; Diane Anastasio’s minimal but forceful drumming, Moore’s florid guitar leads, Jess Scott’s 12-string jangle and uncannily catchy melodies. We’re all significantly bummed out about this band’s potential hiatus, with their drummer moving away, but as the last track slowly shifts into some minimal electronic snaps and clicks we can at least retain some hope of Jess and Scott starting the only post-punk techno project that really matters, right? In their interview here they discussed what continues to make San Francisco a place worth living in, but their music itself makes a pretty strong case. I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again: get a 12-string guitar and leave everything else behind. (Eli Wald)

Soy Not Oi! 2
Edited by Hippycore Krew
312 pgs • $20

 Review by Brooks Headley in MRR 386

A few months ago I did a collaborative dinner with a chef in New York City. This guy, well, he’s a champion of sustainable agriculture and generally a pretty sharp dude in terms of that kind of thing. The dinner we were doing was a conceptual thing that night utilizing mostly wasted and trash food scraps to bring awareness to the sheer amount of food that restaurants throw away. We got to talking, the wasted food idea thing lead me directly into veganism. This fellow, a proud meat eater and meat cooker, looked at me perplexed and asked, “punks are vegetarians…weird?”
The original Soy Not Oi! introduced me to vegan cooking when it came out over 20 years ago, arriving in an envelope at my mom’s house, mail ordered of course. And this new volume, both a collection of new recipes from the Hippycore folks and their friends, and a tribute to Hippycore founder Joel Olson is just plain fucking wonderful. The back cover of the original Soy Not Oi! shows some pissed (get it?) cartoon eggplants and radishes storming a capital building with the subtitle “Over 100 Recipes Designed To Destroy The Government.” Good stuff, stared at that back cover a lot over the years. This new volume shows a cabbage, a cucumber, and an onion hurling off shackles with the subtitle “cast off the chains of corporate food dependency!” Also, good stuff.
The foreword is written by Isa Chandra, who along with Terry Hope Romero are two of my professional punk vegan cookbook writing heroes. Isa confesses her love for the original Soy Not Oi! claiming it as the zine that taught her about food and cooking. Same goes for me. When you read the intros to those recipes, you discover that same goes for almost everyone who contributed a recipe.
In the pre-internet early ’90s, back in the days when the vegan and vegetarian meccas were the East Village of New York City and Berkeley, CA, you had to search out decent veg fare. And unless you lived in one of those two places (I didn’t, I grew up in the suburbs of Baltimore) a lot of times you were cooking the stuff for yourself at home. The original Soy Not Oi! was my guidebook to learning about arrowroot (it’s a thickener, made from a tuber), how to freeze and thaw tofu to get this cool spongy texture, and how to find the best burrito in 1991 (the recipe tells you to fly to San Francisco and go to 16th and Mission). Lots of good, solid information all over Soy Not Oi! 2, too. The primer on what kinds of sugar are cool to use is worth the price alone. And that’s only a single paragraph. Sugar is indeed a minefield, and responsible eating of and sourcing it is something we all need to think about, just like coffee and chocolate and all the stuff that grows far away from where you and I probably live.
Some of the recipes lack salt. I’m assuming this is an oversight. Keep a tin of sea salt or kosher salt nearby along with some freshly ground black pepper and a few lemons. If your finished dish lacks some umph, this stuff can always help. Like a good comp LP, there are contributors trying to show off their chops with complicated multi-step numbers, and others who sent in a nearly non-existent recipe (like the simple tomato sauce recipe….but come to think of it, there’s really no reason ever to buy prepared tomato sauce at the grocery store or the food co-op, so this one is a keeper.) There’s a very workmanlike and almost gruff recipe for steamed vegetables with “steamer sauce” from Ian Mackaye that recommends washing your steamer and pot as the food “cools” so there’s less to clean up later. It’s the most utilitarian and therefore straight-up healthy recipe in the book, and quite possibly Mr. Mackaye’s first recipe contribution to the public domain since the super healthy oatmeal recipe from the “Cooking With Fugazi” article that was in a late ’89 issue of Flipside.
Word-wise, hegemony, conspiracy, and patriarchy all make appearances in the text. As do transnational, corporatist, and “agenda of enslavement,” but when juxtaposed next to a cartoon rutabaga with a Larm hoodie it’s hard to not enjoy the smash the state vibes. There’s a broccoli biscuit recipe that’s a total cinch and references George H.W. Bush’s broccoli aversion (remember that? what kind of motherfucker doesn’t like broccoli??). There are music recommendations for lots of recipes. Some of which are great (The Nips!, Rudimentary Peni!), some questionable (the Doors?), and a few just complete what-the-fucks (sorry, no Rush, ugh, never). But there’s even a suggestion for that popular Amy Winehouse hit from a few years ago (which is actually really good) so it’s not just straight up collector nerd punk stuff. The recipe for whole wheat blueberry flax pancakes recommends a long single song (such as the live version of “Slip It In” from Who’s Got the 10 ½?) due to the fact that they won’t take very long to cook so you don’t want to get distracted with multiple groups.
I got a kick out of the lovingly penned tributes to Joel Olson in the back of the book. One specifically stated with reverence that Joel liked records from bands that were once good but that he liked the groups’ “three records past” when they were actually good. This made me laugh and relieved some shame from my own love of say, the Wartime EP and Cut the Crap. The recipes here are real and written and contributed by folks who are actually vegan and have obviously been cooking this stuff in their home kitchens for a while, which gives the book a really genuine feel. I’ve written a cookbook, and I hang out in the cookbook sections of big goofy bookshops often to browse new recipes. These days there are shitloads of vegan and vegetarian cookbooks out there, a lot of which are written for big publishing conglomerates by people who are most likely not vegan. A book like Soy Not Oi! 2 stands way out from these irresponsible wastes of paper and resource.
My only beef are the seitan recipes that are peppered throughout. Seitan kind of trashes your stomach. I don’t recommend eating it that often, or ever really. But that’s fine, because there’re scads of other great recipes in this volume, so that’s cool. Tempeh is one of the most delicious things out there, so try the buffalo tempeh recipe on page 55 if you are looking for a tasty non-animal protein source. And shit, well, seitan is kind of like smoking cigarettes. Some folks are into it even though they know the health risks. So, fine, go ahead make some seitan, I won’t judge. The tomato canning method on page 274 suggests listening to the Extinction LP by Nausea. I can get behind this. It’s a fantastic record that still sounds great 24 years later. But then the accompanying photo shows someone canning without shoes on. Don’t do that. Wear shoes around boiling and sharp stuff. For me? OK? Wait, so, uh, punks are vegetarians?

Holy fucking shit, this is like manna from heaven for dirt-dumb pogo punk fans. Edmonton’s ABUSE OF SUBSTANCE are ’90s drunk punk to the core, clearly influenced by Japanese masters like TOM & BOOT BOYS and DISCOCKS but closer in spirit and style to the Pogo Attack compilation bands. I’m talking the BRISTLES, I’m talking BANNER OF HOPE, and I’m definitely talking about the motherfucking CASUALTIES. The busy, melodic bass gives the sound a hint of early DEFIANCE as well. 1-2 drumming, 1-2 solos and great WRETCHED ONES gravel-and-whisky lead vocals round out the package. It’s not all for fun though — there is a definite edge to these dudes. Not sure if I’m entirely on board with their pro-violence “Punx Are Mean,” but hopefully that’s all bark and no bite, like the adorable bulldog featured in the back-cover band photo. I’d say “Don’t let the shitty pixelated cover fool you,” but that shitty pixelated cover is a pretty good indicator of the what’s contained herein. These punx don’t know about fuckin’ computers, they know about beer, shitty jobs and getting railed on whatever they can find and shove up their noses (plus, having a shitty pixelated cover is totally ’90s). If you have any, and I mean any kind of soft spot for ’90s street/drunk punk, you need this fucking record in your life.

Bass-heavy noise/proper indie rock and punk from Croatia. There’s lots of disjointed guitars vocals in Croatian which, like other Slavic languages, is a really great language for music. Loads of push-pull tempos, sharp guitar tones, and big strums the way it outta be — no snoozy Pitchfork-approved/trendy fest moves here — imagine a faster SHELLAC and maybe a less-spastic and way more interesting RODAN. On the other hand, VLASTA POPIĆ does some excellent straight up punker tunes like on “Slijepa Nasa [Mrznja],” as well as a sort of SONIC YOUTH-y style on “Mastanje.” The rest of the album gets slower for a few songs (but still captivating) and plays around with different vocals and structures. And lest I forget — the incredible “O vodi” gives off a real SCRAWL (Ohio) style. Very recommended!

This band has managed to ride a glowing Tim Yo record review from nearly 20 years ago into the realm of near-legend. Surprisingly, that debut 7” is one I still count amongst my faves of the era, worthy of being mentioned alongside REATARDS, LOLI AND THE CHONES and EPILEPTIX when it comes to primitive, shitty-teenager punk rock. And Wisconsin’s LAST SONS OF KRYPTON may be the shittiest teenagers of them all—at least that’s the case this long-overdue LP is making. Every one of the twenty tunes collected here represents a life’s work for some true teenage fuck-ups, and the quality of the racket is generally higher than it has any real right to be. Their sensitivities and “worldview” couldn’t be any lower though, offering up some kind of perverse balance that keeps them punk boneheads until death. Whatever. A gang of insufferable, bratty and delinquent assholes making a racket outta sheer frustration and hatred of their lives and surroundings is always gonna be punker than shit, and LAST SONS OF KRYPTON fit that bill perfectly.

Filling out a hardcore full-length — at 33 rpm, no less—is one of the harder tasks in the challenging world of music, but after a 12” EP and a couple of 7”s GAY KISS have measured themselves up to the task. It helps if you’re a band that knows how to use the extra space, and GAY KISS are experts at twisting negative space in and out of time and tempo. The first track starts strong, rides out what sounds like a fade out of distant kick drum thump, then snaps back into a bedroom mosh-worthy breakdown. “Preservation Measures” is full of whiplash-inducing unpredictability and feverish guitar work, totally restless playing all over the frequency spectrum. Sometimes it sounds like the guitarist threw his instrument away in favor of a power drill or a dial-up modem hooked up to a Rat pedal. The strongest tracks here stretch out and use the empty space to let a riff unravel and implode before taking it somewhere else. “Relent,” for instance, lets a SACCHARINE TRUST-style riff collapse, cave in on itself and get back on its feet over and over again over a shifting set of fills. Fans of freaky hardcore bands in the game such as NASA SPACE UNIVERSE, the LOWEST FORM, and WHITE WARDS will find a lot to like here. Complete with some great cover artwork, another tremendously sick package from Sorry State.

I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again… NATURE BOYS are a band that people are not paying enough attention to now, but will miss when they’re gone. They combine equal parts of punk, hardcore, living on the fringes, hard living, DEAD MOON and their own inimitable style to make something that is their own. “Pissy Wind” is perfect. It’s a fast fucking song about the toxicity of surrounding yourself with people who are consumed by bad fucking vibes…or that’s what I took from it, at least. Two genders on the mic at all times. “Coast to Coast” on the flip side slows down (barely), a mid-tempo ode to dead friends (maybe???). It’s there to help you relive the pain of life or the inevitable return of something we’ve all felt, but have rarely given name to…sometimes known colloquially as “The Great Terribleness.” The bumbling of our stupid selves as we rocket through space on a dumb piece of rock. After releasing two LPs and one EP, NATURE BOYS have added new drummer Alex Moss on this record, which has tightened their whole mess up considerably. The whole band sounds more focused…concise even…and these two songs just aren’t enough for me, but I’ll wait patiently for the next few songs to trickle out of their dilapidated Kansas City homes.

This impressive slice of underground music history was released on 200 tapes in Buenos Aires in 1988, never having enjoyed the vinyl format until now. I must say, definitely better late than never. Playing an early hardcore style that hasn’t forgotten its punk roots, SOBERANÍA PERSONAL is like the convergence of GRB and the BAGS. “En Verdad es una Gran Verdad,” on the other hand, is a haunting and slow punk-metal sermon with the reverb cranked up. The powerful and dynamic female vocals are really incredible on this record. At times the riffs recall DISCHARGE infused with enticing bass melodies such as in my favorite track so far, “Maskavidrio.” The influence of the irreverent snark of LA POLLA RECORDS is also well played and detectable through their cover of “Socios a la Fuerza” and their band name, which is derived from one of the legendary Spanish punk group’s verses. From the insert it’s evident that this band also ran in the same circles as their friends ATTAQUE 77. In fact, my second favorite song on the record, “Falsas Esperanzas,” is a cover of ATTAQUE 77’s parallel hardcore project DEFENSA Y JUSTICIA, which was already defunct at the time of recording this tape. The intelligent lyrics delve deep into the frustration, anger, and disenchantment that coming of age during the bloody Argentine military dictatorship would entail, paired with a searing indictment of machismo in “Supermacho.” Props to the Metadona label who also pressed the QLOAQA LETAL tape onto wax last year, saving both bands from the dustbin of punk history. So recommended!

The second full-length from Hudiksvall, Sweden’s KRONOFOGDEN (“Enforcement Officer”) shares some obvious DNA with the legendary bands from their hometown (members of MISSBRUKARNA even do guest a chorus on one track), but charges harder on a ramshackle USHC bent, with vocals quickly spat out over fourteen straightforward hardcore bursts. Sturdy, linear drumming propels the fuzzed-out gnarl of guitar distortion, as the angry vocals and shouted choruses in Swedish scrape the volume peaks of their slightly distorted recording. With enough elements stewing, this sturdy engine here stirs things up enough to keep it on edge like a noisier, more raw take on the best moments of DS-13 and ETA, and the second side has a few more crunchy downbeat moments that shadow some TOTALITÄR poundings. The title (which translates to “Work and/or Leisure”) reveals a good portion of the lyrics’ meanings, with English translations explaining how they questioning the Swedish relationship to work and employment, the cost of public transportation in traditionally poorer areas of their city, the closing of youth centers, and other local issues. Cover artwork is pen-and-ink scribble, somewhere between MAGGOT SANDWICH and MUNICIPAL WASTE, with assembly lines, robot cops, zombies and more. Also comes with a 16-page comic. Killer!

Absolutely relentless in approach, the SOLUTIONS record is fast, diverse and flawlessly executed. The music is textured with an unreal degree of precision and skill. With a foot firmly planted on the gas SOLUTIONS delivers an elite caliber of songwriting and musicianship that falls somewhere between the traditional rage of powerviolence and the mind-melting vision of progressive, melodic hardcore. Not unlike Buffalo’s GAS CHAMBER, with whom they share two members, the SOLUTIONS collection is a myriad of sounds pushing and playing off of each other only to combine for a galloping dive into a unified force of strength and rhythm, effectively rendering comparisons and genre assignments useless. Upping the ante rendered by the likes of the DEAD LANGUAGE or the crippling works of IRON LUNG, these boundary-pushing and genre-defining efforts have new company. Truly an impressive effort on this tragically short and criminally scarce release. Buy this record, tape this record, steal download codes, whatever it takes…hear this, because you haven’t heard it before.

Several things set BARCELONA apart from any prospective peers. First and foremost, the powerful vocals from the singer of FIRMEZA 10, with some of the most biting, bilious and determined lyrics in recent memory. Meanwhile the drums circle around conventional hardcore, never quite settling into anything comfortable, coming across more often as a struggle than a direct assault. “Bomba,” for instance, plays for about fifteen seconds of a short and vicious song before sliding into a solid minute of despair. It might only be sixty seconds long, but in this context it acts as a lengthy statement: hypnotic, plodding rhythms undergird a wailing guitar expounding confused exasperation. This whole record feels like the cover artwork. Anxiety looms over each song (no subtlety or surprise as the album opens with “Ansiedad”), but so does anger—as esoteric as it is savage. Extremo Nihilismo is the defiant sum of its parts and its history: there is no mistaking this record as anything but the culmination of the best and most intriguing aspects of recent Spanish punk and hardcore. All in barely eleven minutes.

These are some freaky-ass tracks right here. From the label that brought you WHATEVER BRAINS and BRAIN FLANNEL (and a host of other outta this galaxy shit) comes the DAVIDIANS single. When the needle dropped and those groovy, angular bass licks kicked in I was mesmerized. Straight up, a sound that would make GANG OF FOUR blush (then curse for not doin’ it in ’79). The vocalist is the epitome of the snotty frontman. Dude is all nasal. Sounds like he hasn’t blown his nose in a month. And while this dude is screamin’, the guitar is pretty much doin’ its own thing. At points they meet up and play together but really, I feel like both stringed instruments are reading off entirely different music sheets. I feel like these folks get some of their cues from the more angular post punk acts like PIL or the freakier WIRE tracks, but with way more of a focus on speed and obnoxious delivery. I had to listen to this record a couple of times to get some sort of hold on it, and I’m not sure I even got it. I just know this record is great. Very stoked to listen and re-listen. Buy buy buy!

This is a beautiful reissue. It sounds and looks amazing, the band pix are so cool — especially the photo of Carol and Judy posing in front of the Tropicana — and will make you wanna change your style immediately. The all-neon-pink sleeve (including the inside) is such a sick touch! This includes all the available PINK SECTION tracks, including their live tracks from the Deaf Club, their 45 and 12”, and a couple of amazing demos. Named after the arts and entertainment supplement of the San Francisco Chronicle, PINK SECTION shared members with the untouchable INFLATABLE BOY CLAMS, and lived in North Beach when you could find a three-bedroom apartment for $250 total… I read an interview with them where they talked about only needing to work one day a week to make their rent! The thought of that possibility makes a modern punk shudder, endless tragedies in the face of the end of San Francisco (or pretty much any city you can name that was cool in other more magical eras at this point in time). These are total surreal SF sounds with shattered manic new wave flourishes, true art punk in the best sense of the concept. So many ideas crammed into each frantic song, the lyrics are especially ironic and hilarious, cutting and sharp witted, taking down the decadent rich hippies that decamped to Marin when things got harsh, the involuntary demands of consumer culture, and militant chic while retaining a flip throwaway pop art affect. I guess the closest comparison band would be SUBURBAN LAWNS, except I don’t hate it when the guys sing…This record is a cut-up, a total up-all-night dance party with sick keyboards, shards of guitars, and the coolest male/female vocals, deconstructing new wave and the truth.

Tormented and pummeling crust metal from Prague. None more heavy with landscape-leveling chords, and unscrupulously dark themes that churn within howling and gravely vocal tones.

All the while this LP remains HELLHAMMER-ing old school and DISGUST-ingly punk. MÖRKHIMMEL share members with a slew of bands from BETON and GUIDED CRADLE to HELLSHOCK. I feel lucky to be reviewing this because it is a fucking awesome LP. Ugly as shit, brooding, and thrashing.

A studio-only two-piece masquerading as a power trio, the proceedings here are consistently anthemic as all hell; usually cold and yearning, occasionally funky and danceable, and, on songs like “New Middle Ages,” approximating a more anarcho SAD LOVERS AND GIANTS.

Holy shit!!! This is the very definition of a juggernaut! Based on their legacy, the fact that DEMOLITION delivers an incredibly powerful record comes as no surprise…but from the mostly instrumental intro track they drop severe tonnage on Bombenhagel, and the intensity skyrockets from there. The base here is fist-in-the-air anthemic Japanese hardcore but there are overt NYHC elements that fall just short of beatdown breakdowns, and their integration of ’80s heavy fucking metal into the mix is both shameless and brilliant. Even on mid-tempo plodders like “Hail Satan” (which is really little more than a Sunset Strip banger with VENOM vocals) the foot never leaves your throat. A seriously incredible release, taking punks’ flirtations with metal and launching them beyond simple MOTÖRHEAD worship (which is easy), injecting the hooks into jaw dropping Japanese hardcore. The bar just got a little higher, metalpunks—now you’ve got something else to strive for. And again: Holy shit!!

I’ve been lucky enough to see the NEIGHBORHOOD BRATS a handful of times as well as play a show with them, which is fortunate because as of this writing they announced that they are no longer. R.I.P. NEIGHBORHOOD BRATS. Recovery is a great album to close on — solid fucking punk. The first three tracks “Year of the Brat,” “Boys for 20 Years” and “Complete Mess” are by far the stand-outs, and those songs alone are worth buying this LP for. Other highlights include “Painted and Gutted,” which has a catchy as fuck retro ’80s punk brainworm melody, and the closer, “The Pharmacy Is Closer Than the Liquor Store,” a definite ripper. “Escape the City” is a menacing surf instrumental that serves as almost an intermission, a deep breath before getting back to business. Jenny Angelillo’s vocals are controlled throughout — she only really screams it out in “50 Shades of Fuck You.” The grip of her voice around each melody shows she’s in control. The engine which propels each song is George Rager’s guitar work, an incredibly catchy, fast and furious surf guitar with riff after sweet riff, never out of step, completely calculated, but never obvious in the least. Shit. Is. Tight. Their sound can be best summed up as a mix of NIGHT BIRDS, ADOLESCENTS, and WIPERS, with a cleaner and more modern take on ’80s punk. Damn shame it’s their last release. Highly recommended.

The first pleasant surprise of 2015 came to me all the way from Melbourne, Australia, thanks to this 7″ EP from DRIBBLE. Everything from this band’s name to their art direction — not to mention their provenance via Cool Death and Distort Records — would indicate whiplash-inducing, noisy hardcore slime along the lines of that last VELVET WHIP tape. I’d already cleared all my things off of my desk at my old apartment to avoid knocking anything over due to involuntary thrashing when I dropped the needle onto a riff that sounds like it could have come out of the LORDS OF THE NEW CHURCH songbook. A different sort of greasy vibe than the one I was expecting, but a nonetheless appropriate soundtrack to some post/romantic lyrical meditations on obsession, masochism, and wandering through the city streets. Over the course of my own daily meandering online I turned up a flyer for a bill the group shared with LOW LIFE, which sounds like a well-matched lineup of Down Under down-and-outers exploring the dark depths of performing urban masculinity through fuzz and chorus effects. The B-side takes a slightly slower VOIDOIDS-esque trudge into the same streets as they empty out, save for the obsessive wanderers and nihilist observers. We also have one last drugstore cowboy song on this one, riding the same chord progression and arrangement as the last two tunes all the way into the sunset of this short but sweet record. These are streets we’ve walked before, but a lot like a close friend of yours who tells you the same two or three jokes over and over again, it might just grow on you. The labels responsible have assembled a handsome and elegant package here with a sixpanel 14″ x 21″ poster insert and lyric sheet. Naturally, looks like this one is already sold out. If I were to win a wager on the 50-50 chance between some new recordings getting dribbled out and the band going out in a blaze of ignoble glory, I’d put my winnings towards that next 7″.

Over the past ten years or so, these San Diego punks have built up quite a solid discography, but I can’t think of another recording of theirs that has had such an immediate and visceral impact. From the timeless opening mosh riff/“Yeeeaaaaaah” to the subtly tweaked recording to the raging solos and rock-solid rhythm section this is the work of a band that’s firing on all fucking cylinders. The snarled vocals and metallic touches betray quite a bit of SEPTIC DEATH influence (a comparison I don’t make lightly) but the backbone is rooted in the straightforward drive of ’80s East Coast hardcore à la SSD or ANTIDOTE. The churning title track starts out with a gloomy almost SAMHAIN vibe that stands out from the rest of the record while still fitting in beautifully, building into a chaotic wail that ends the album with a rush of energy. If CRIME DESIRE wasn’t on your radar before then they damn sure should be now. Great stuff!

Interesting debut EP here from this band made up of 1990s UK punk/hardcore vets. YOUNG CONSERVATIVES comes out of the gate wearing their politics on their sleeves, but it’s not trite or clichéd political hardcore. These are the angry ruminations of disillusioned older punks. Like many of us, they find it hard to be optimistic about the political future despite the small positive gains that have been made. The backdrop to the disenchantment takes the form of six tracks of somewhat melodic, yet heavy, mid-paced hardcore. It’s an enjoyable maelstrom of LEATHERFACE, ROLLINS BAND, DAG NASTY, and FUCKED UP. The FUCKED UP comparison is most strongly felt in the vocal delivery, mainly because the vocals take the form of hoarsely shouted complicated political diatribes, rather than the more tuneful singing you get with the likes of DAG NASTY or even LEATHERFACE. Great stuff, I look forward to hearing more.

The difference seems to be that where Primitive was more of a genre exercise or homage to their Boston hardcore forefathers — albeit the best example I have ever heard (and a perfect record) — Fire shows “the STRANGLAH ‘finding’ their own sound.” Still present are the noticeably-Boston steamrolling riffs, but more “punk” influence has stepped up its role, mostly in the form of bass hooks, vocal melodies and guitar leads, which are most obvious on tracks like “Forward into Hell” and “Broken Spirit” and in the outro of “Slow Burn.” I can’t tell you how many times a day those choruses or leads pop into my head. The difference is definitely subtle, because this is very obviously the same frustration-spitting cobra backed by a sonic wrecking crew armed with the power of a major metropolitan DPW crew laying down the best cold-weather hardcore on the planet, making you feel just as bad about yourself as you do about the trash around you, with just as much misplaced youthful anger as real world adult problems staring you in the face. In my eyes, Fire is BOSTON STRANGLER’s best effort and a more singular record. Fantastic.

Reissue of the Week: ALIANS Gavroche LP

Named after the street urchin child of Victor Hugo’s Les Misérables, Gavroche was a cassette-only LP originally released in 1994 by ALIANS (Alliance), a prolific Polish band from the early ’90s which blended the classic, upbeat mid-tempos of Polish hardcore punk with rhythmic doses of reggae and ska and additional folksy instrumentation on accordion, congas, flute and keyboards. A classic recording of this then-trendy style, the experimental and adaptive edge of both the musicianship here and Polish punk itself steers it away from the train wreck suggested on paper. Robotic staccato vocals dart between rushing 1-2 charges of straightforward hardcore before breaking into a passage of dub or the accordion player jumps into the fray. There’s something that always seems incredibly inauthentic and, uh, “highlander” when bands from the US try this kind of folksy avant-garde punk but it’s hard to find deep fault with a band from Poland, where punk seems to both be more flexible in its expression and a broader extension of deep roots in a long lineage of community. Reaching for instruments of the past doesn’t seem that out of line (there’s even a flute and dub riffing off of the CLASH’s “Guns of Brixton”). I don’t always find the additional instrumentation completely seamless—in fact, it is occasionally tentative and stumbling—but this record still remains a challenging and interesting listen 20 years after its initial release, and is recommended for the open-minded who’ve ticked off their APATIA, ARMIA, and POST REGIMENT boxes, as the chassis of this still rests on similar, solid, classic songwriting. Anthemic punk with lyrics entirely in Polish with no translation, the entire original cassette release is encompassed in this first-time-on-vinyl reissue, along with a few of the additional tracks from its ’90s and ’00s subsequent reissues on CD and extended cassette.

I loved this band’s demo, so I was psyched to see this EP in the review pile. Hits somewhere between FERTIL MISERIA and the NURSE! Tough and vicious — the totally sick, blown-out guitars, commandeering vocals, and rumbling, threatening rhythm section all conspire to sound like they’re gonna fall apart, but really, they know exactly what they are doing and it’s a savage punk attack destined to mutate minds everywhere. DESTRUYE Y HUYE‘s lyrics are dark and reflect an alienated existence, a GREG SAGE meets ESKORBUTO reality. The music is crude and primitive; it all reflects the existential reality of modern life. Angee’s vocals are so raging and cool, so charismatic, they totally take it over the top. I hope these women tour the West Coast ASAP! The insert has a cool, almost poster quality to it, really iconic and classic punk looking.

No modern band could possibly carry on the musical tradition of bands like CRASS and ALTERNATIVE like NO SIR, I WON’T. When bands simply fill out popular punk templates it’s boring. That’s kinda what NO SIR, I WON’T is doing, but it’s really cool and interesting; definitely not boring. Their craft is innovative and provoking while recalling moments of the classics. They have specific things they want to say, and they do it vehemently and effectively: poetic, but easy to digest and analyze. Every statement is bold and delivered cleverly. Each chord progression, break, and rhythmic change is compelling. They won me over on the split with AUTONOMY that came out a few months ago, but this EP is even better! Feeling proud to be a punk right now.

Based in São Paulo and featuring members of RAKTA and SPEED KILLS, this is a refreshing take on goth-inspired post-punk that escapes some of the vampirical trappings that tend to mark this style. I’m reminded of CHRISTIAN DEATH, but with the driving quality of KILLING JOKE. The vocals, however, sung both in English and Portuguese, are unmistakably and aggressively punk. For me, there is a certain musicality characterizing Brazilian Portuguese punk vocals and I can’t help but compare the singing here a bit to CÓLERA. My favorite track thus far is “Inverted,” where the infectious guitar lead woven through the whole length of the song strikes a delicate balance between chorus-tinged goth and the delightful jangle of surf punk. The rhythm is quite varied and takes the listener on a journey through hammering beats and slower, more experimental percussion. Everything comes together with groovy bass lines and intriguing soundscapes/effects: totally multidimensional and awesome. The record is well packaged too, featuring an insert with all the lyrics and some incredible artwork.

Valerie Solanas: The Defiant Life of the Woman Who Wrote SCUM (and Shot Andy Warhol)
Breanne Fahs
The Feminist Press
Review by E. Conner in MRR #380
Valerie Solanas is a strange cultural icon. She is perhaps most often used as a derogatory warning for young women: “the wrong kind of feminist.” In an age of combating #womenagainstfeminism with cupcakey bullshit and Kathleen Hanna documentaries, this lack of historical accuracy and nuance is detrimental. We require Valerie to be represented as what she truly was: a fiercely intellectual militant feminist who died poor and alone because this world kills people like that.
Personally, Valerie is of interest to me in charting these people, the controversial, difficult women that are forgotten and discarded. Even among them Valerie is not alone is her abandonment. The great failures are Valerie Solanas, Lee Lozano and Shulamith Firestone. All attempted to straddle art and politics, all chose madness and obscurity in lieu of becoming washed out in the limelight. Nuts to the Steinems!
In April I visited New York City and was lucky enough to attend a release event at NYU for this book. An intimidating panel included Avital Ronell, Lisa Duggan, Karen Finley and the author, Breanne Fahs. As the panel went on I slowly realized what was happening. I was in a room full of (mostly) beautiful, smart women repeating the word “shit” over and over. I like to think this was the utopia Valerie imagined so long ago.
I understand that in even articulating that idea I’m doing exactly what everyone has ever done to Valerie’s work. I project my own desires into the intricate complications of her life, art and work. We exist in this place where refining women (and other complicated people) into flattened figures is the norm. Is it even possible to tell a story of history in a way that isn’t problematic? It’s so riddled with the afflictions of opinion and memory failure.
Fahs is a delicate biographer. She fills in nuance without betraying the subject. She’s compassionate and holistic. What is produced feels dense. While it’s not a totally critical history, it is one that demands an active participant. The story of Valerie’s years in New York’s Lower East Side, culminating in her infamous act, are bookended by the brutal years that created and destroyed the human being. It’s perhaps not fair to conceptualize a human life as a flickering light with a crescendo.
When one regards the tragedy of Solanas’s life it’s too easy to conjure pity and rely on that as some accurate representation of her total legacy. The truth is Valerie saved us. She undeniably produced a cultural crack-up. The burgeoning feminist consciousness raising movement would have been nothing without her. While so much organization was vulcanized at the time of her arrest, theory too owes her a great debt. Shulamith Firestone’s conceptualized “Smile Strike,” from the far more validated The Dialectic of Sex was preceded by Solanas’ call for the death of niceness. Modern theoretical feminism and queer theory still look towards SCUM for guidance. Kathi Weeks’ “non-work” recalls Valerie’s “un-working.” Sara Ahmed’s “feminist killjoy” and Lauren Berlant and Lee Edelman’s beckoning towards an academically sanctioned queer nihilism all have foundations in SCUM.
There has been a tendency to regard Valerie as an accident. She is often removed or distanced from revisionist feminist history. While it’s true that she never did fit in with the publicized movement, she does not deserve to be forgotten. Valerie was as much of a disruption to the slide into co-opting radical feminism towards liberal reformism, or as it’s been suggested, just a disruption in general. Her personal effect on the lives of some of the most cherished minds of this movement is not to be undermined. The correspondence with and testimony of Ti-Grace Atkinson, Roxanne Dunbar-Ortiz, Florence Kennedy, Shulamith Firestone and Robin Morgan are all included, finally cementing Solanas in her place among them.
A legacy like this deserves a considerate articulation. Fahs took ten years to write the book Valerie swore she’d write herself. This kind of care for Solanas’ life is uncommonly kind when you consider the treatment Valerie’s work received the second anyone else got their hands on it. All of it has been stolen, lost, edited, misspelled, withheld, hidden, and destroyed.
Even now, the bulk of Valerie’s surviving work (SCUM Manifesto) is printed and distributed largely by the anarchist-publishing house AK Press. Every few years another edition comes out with another forward written by a different person. The most recent edition touts notorious Marilyn Manson fan Michelle Tea’s take on the manifesto. Ms. Tea, once a young radical dyke poet, is now the editor of a popular hipster motherhood blog. While the lesbian mother could be one interpretation of Valerie’s demand for “complete automation” it still feels something like failure. And where does the money go?
Valerie Solanas is an attempt to map the great sources of the paranoia that were Valerie’s downfall. Like any young woman, her sexuality and psychic body were mangled early on. Part of the map of Valerie’s life is strongly situated in the way she defined and declared her vision. Fahs uses Valerie’s own words whenever possible. It’s rather exciting for any Solanas fans out there to get to eek whatever they can out of the quotes from Up Your Ass, various interviews, college newspaper articles, and correspondence that Fahs had access to.
These kinds of considerations are partly due to Fahs’ background in Feminist Studies and Psychology, a very important distinction in the overall tone of the book. Fahs is careful to include the reputation and conditions of not only the institutions that Valerie landed in after shooting Andy Warhol, but critically traces her movements through schools, the hospitals where she gave birth to at least two children, residential hotels, jail cells, collective meetings, diners and beds. You see this complicated figure moving about truly alive and conscious, wading through the same shit as all of us.
I finished the book on the train headed to work. I got off two stops early and rode my bike to the place Valerie died. Alone in a hotel room (and never wanted once) for at least five days. The front of the Bristol Hotel is collaged with handwritten notes regarding hotel policies and notes to UPS drivers. A historical site plaque bulges from the wall. It neglects to mention the two most famous residents, Valerie and Richard Ramirez, aka the “Night Stalker,” notorious serial killer/rapist and Satanist.

Listen up, because this one’s great, straight outta Granada in the autonomous region of Andalusia! Super catchy, poppy, guitar-driven garage rock, with unabashed punk ’77 flares and lots of very memorable, well orchestrated hooks and choruses. Their name and the post-modern subtitle concept of “an idea dies…another is born” matches the smart and excited execution of the COPYCATS‘ material, and each song makes me stir in my seat as I think of what might have inspired them: the GUN CLUB, WIRE, the FLESH EATERS, the VIBRATORS, the JAM. There are even moments when the singer sounds like an agitated Mick Jagger (and that’s not necessarily a bad thing, an homage perhaps to the ’60s influence they undeniably have but do not flaunt) though most of the time he carries off a blaze, cheeky attitude akin to Darby Crash, Jay Reatard, or Trent Ruane of the MUMMIES. Don’t let all these poached sonic trinkets mislead you. The songwriting is catchy and not overly complicated (yes, there’s an opening riff that sounds like “London Calling”) but they do a terrific and creative job of mixing their influences into something genuine, grander, and ultimately their own. Some bands end up being bad imitators of their heroes, and then some bands just do actually sound like they fell through a time portal. Socially conscious lyrics in English, great cover artwork and, all in all, a really nice surprise. After about 50 listens it still has me hooked!

Finally, one of the truly mythical, long-lost giants of American…nay, world… hardcore is unearthed from the sweeping sands of time. In December of 1983 this Boston hardcore powerhouse recorded seven songs with Jimmy Dufour at Radiobeat Studios in Kenmore Square, with the intention of mixing three songs — “Tailgate,” “Break the Chains” and “Condemned for Life” — for airplay on local college radio. They did just that. In 1989 those three songs ended up on vinyl via a semi(?)-legit 7” on the Armory Arms imprint, and again in 1992 on a much-less-legit repress on Lost and Found, along with the four unreleased tracks, assumed to be lost for good in a dumpster following the shuttering of Radiobeat. Noooope, this one jerkoff seems to have had ’em the whole time, knowing full well that the band was looking for them. They did eventually get ’em back, thank fuck. Anyway, DEATHWISH played within that classically Boston realm of nasty, first wave straightedge hardcore, fitting seamlessly alongside the bulldozing power of SS DECONTROL, IMPACT UNIT, DYS and LAST RIGHTS. With the huge guitars that Radiobeat was known for, the remix job here by Don Zientara (MINOR THREAT, et al.) sounds incredible. I highly suggest that if you think this record is just another attempt to milk American Hardcore’s glory days for whatever it is they are milking it for, you rethink that and cop this record ASAP. In my humble opinion, this material seeing a vinyl reissue is about as important as any other record that will come out in 2014, and I find reissues counterproductive and boring. RIP, Jordan Wood. Now we can all hold our collective breath until progress on the DXA record kicks back up.

For anyone not familiar with HOUNDS OF HATE (smell the coffee, what’s with you?), they play masterful NYHC akin to BREAKDOWN, SICK OF IT ALL, WARZONE, and similar acts, and are experts at writing involved, memorable songs with huge hooks and production that precisely matches their influences. The same sound, production, and attention to song/riff-writing detail are all still here, and they have gotten tighter as a band, but this record strikes me as a little more cerebral and a little less straight-up nonstop moshy than their previous efforts, with definite hard rock influence seamlessly interwoven into the NYHC. It may or may not be a coincidence that the riff that opens this record very closely resembles that of “Alan’s On Fire” by POISON IDEA, but I hear some War All the Time at different points. “Teenage Blues” opens with a straight-up ’70s rock riff played at hardcore speed, with solo to match, gradually settling back into NYHC territory before briefly revisiting the opening riff at the end. The following song has an AC/DC-type riff at one point. They also use gang vocals for the first time in a few songs, adding a cool dimension. HOUNDS OF HATE avoid the common hardcore-band’s-second-LP pitfalls, where bands do shitty or undistinguished versions of their earlier records, or attempt a different musical direction that is at best beyond their ability or at worst generic and self-indulgent (also known as “maturing”). Instead, HOUNDS OF HATE follow up their stellar first LP with a second that retains everything that makes them great as a band, while switching up their sound in a way that is not only still raging and interesting, but also makes this record its own entity in this band’s discography.

More complete life annihilation from Western Mass, NO FAITH deal in harsh, sludged-out powerviolence, bookended by passages of haunting industrial noise. Featuring most of the same membership as VACCINE (still my favorite straightedge band of all time, sorry nerds), their knee-deep pedigree also includes time in SQRM, ORCHID, AMPERE, and RELICS along with countless others. Some referents from the powerviolence world would include, well, VACCINE, or at times perhaps a totally scummed-out IRON LUNG, but there’s an oozing quality to the production that puts this in a whole other world of sonic nastiness. Lots of MOSS-worthy amplifier worship for those of you who know how to get down, revisiting some of the same territory explored in vocalist Will Killingsworth’s drone/doom solo project the TOLL. The noise segments are fantastic on their own terms and complement the music perfectly, never once feeling like an add-on or afterthought. Honestly, this is just the best shit.

Recorded in 1979, utilizing just a few hours of remnant studio time, X forever scarred the tough-as-all-hell history of Aussie rock ’n’ roll with Aspirations. Boasting ROSE TATTOO’s Ian Rilen and the roaring, he-man punk legend Steve Lucas up front, the LP begins with the classic pummeling of “Suck Suck” and only gets more severe from there. “Good On Ya Baby” out-struts a band like THE SAINTS — no easy feat. “Batman” is steroid-bolstered art punk that has rarely, if ever, been equaled. “I Don’t Wanna Go Out” is completely past-it and genius. Fourteen vicious, out-for-blood punk tunes, all of which are steeped in some supremely heavy, dark and daring shit. It’s a legit classic and one of the best punk rock albums ever made. Should any doubt linger in your mind, or if for some reason you have no clue what the fuck this LP is, there’s not a single record in these pages [MRR #379] more deserving of your immediate attention.

What a nice surprise! The two Oliviers. A record put out by Olivier Crapoulet featuring a new band by Olivier Gasoil (HATEPINKS, IRRITONES, etc.). Two fine-twisted gentlemen and two of my favorite Urinepeeins. LA FLINGUE starts out like POW! with feedback and French obscenities (I think?). It’s the usual amphetamine, hate-filled punk rock with tight melodies you’d expect from this crew of degenerates. Excellent. I’m not familiar with Brazil’s ORNITORRINCOS but they start out with a GERMS sample? They play some really tight, melodic, SoCal inspired punk. There’s some hints of Oi! in there and they deliberately (I think) steal some famous guitar riffs for their songs. Good stuff.

Yes! This is the reissue of the sole LP by SIN 34, one of the first (the first?) Southern California hardcore bands to be fronted by a woman — and a raging teenage punk girl at that. Formed in Santa Monica in 1981, rumor has it that Julie Lanfeld stole most of a drum kit for Dave Markey (of We Got Power fanzine) after he told her he wanted to start a band. He learned to play without a kick pedal or snare, using a metal lampshade as a cymbal and literally kicking the bass drum when he wanted to use it. By the time they entered the studio to record this LP, Markey had upgraded to a “proper” kit, but the songs retain their somewhat desperate quality — these kids loved NECROS and DEVO equally (even covering the latter), saw and played with and absorbed the sounds of their co-conspirators TSOL and BLACK FLAG. Like all truly great bands, everyone here learned to play their instruments for this group — it’s not inept, but rather, chaotic. This is straightforward hardcore, but they are songs written via osmosis and immersion, rather than careful study, identifiable conventions twisted and warped as a result. They are funny and pissed off in equal measure. Julie switches from deadpan to aggressive in a second, sixteen years old and absolutely furious.
I’m currently reading a book about Naomi Petersen, the staff photographer for SST and one of the lone women in the hyper-masculine orbit of Black Flag. It was a gift, and the inscription describes it as “Carducci’s hesitant capitulation to feminism, a typical man-apology.” A lot of things about the text are infuriating but it’s also one of the only documents of the role women played in what was both one of the most macho and most influential punk scenes in history. The importance of women like Naomi and Julie cannot be overstated and their histories have largely been erased. Tobi Vail contributes liner notes to this reissue, reclaiming Julie and the other women like her for the history of USHC and the global punk and wider cultural movements it influenced. They are required reading. An excerpt: “[This record] is irrefutable proof that teenage girls actively participated in the creation of American hardcore… Briefly, so the story goes, after women helped invent punk/new wave in the ’70s we were pushed to the sidelines in the ’80s when the music and dancing got too aggressive and “hardcore,” i.e. too masculine for us to hack. Then, in the early ’90s riot grrrl supposedly came along to rescue girls from male oppression and we have ruled the pit ever since. Bullshit. Girls were there the whole time. We just didn’t have the visibility or respect we got later on. We fought to be taken seriously and we won. We all deserve credit for this cultural shift but the women involved in ’80s hardcore punk especially need to be recognized for their contribution to the evolution of culture. This history does not deserve to be obscure.”
Hopefully it won’t be any longer. Released on CD (with three unreleased tracks) for the first time ever, and back in print on LP (with the original track listing) for the first time in many decades later this fall, it also includes commentary from Dave Markey and Thurston Moore (whose contribution is mercifully so short I almost missed it). I’m thrilled that this record will be recirculating in the world.

This is a killer package containing a split 7” of totally bonkers heavy psych featuring Japan’s SPEED GURU with Kawabata from ACID MOTHER’S TEMPLE and Tabata from AMT/ZENI GEVA/BOREDOMS. PLASTIC CRIMEWAVE is outta Chicago and has been playing variants of psych and space rock since the late ’90s. The record comes with a comic book that is packaged like the old Power Records comic book LPs (Planet of the Apes, Spiderman vs. The Lizard People, etc.). SPEED GURU lays the smackdown with a ton of distortion on “Speed Guru Theme,” which is just the band saying their name over and over while fast and heavy psych plays over it. It’s essentially the same song that PLASTIC CRIMEWAVE does on their side, only with a different self-shoutout. They later get into a wild hippie/improv trip, which is much better than it sounds, I assure you. PLASTIC CRIMEWAVE’s opener also has simple, heavy fuzzedout bombastic wah-wah and the second song is even more fuzzed out and distorted to hell. Musically this isn’t punk like you know it but it’s certainly DIY, which I can dig, ya dig?
The enclosed book is a rad action comic illustrated by Plastic Crimewave (the person), which he co-writes with Kawabata. Crimewave also has done incredible work with his book-sized zine Galactic Zoo Dossier, which covers loads of psych/proto-punk/space rock knowns and unknowns, and is all handwritten and hand drawn. The cover shows Kawabata as an “electric samurai” wailing his guitar into the outworlds. The line work, especially the used of cross-hatching and shadows is fantastic. The story of various psychedelic/garage rock superheroes starts with Speed Guru not being able to draw comics after a bike accident. He goes to see Ancient Asahito (who’s drawn like Keiji Haino as a monk) at the Acid Mother’s Temple who tells him to “channel the elegant vibrations of the Cosmic Force of Electricity” (and probably the ability to release a million records). This also features some great drawings of Kawabata, who is the Speed Guru and student of Asahito. Eventually, Speed Guru and Plastic Crimewave come to blows as Plastic attempts the “Mystic Garage Punk Chop” (which is likely a nod to ACID MOTHERS TEMPLE’s love for pro wrestling and the fact that they often choke-slam guitars during shows). The story continues on with the battle of sound waves and space jams. I won’t spoil the rest as you’ll have to get this…and soon!

This band has done a lot in its three or so years, and I think it just keeps getting better. They play catchy, sped-up, undistorted melodic punk steeped in the late ’70s, but with a hardcore urgency — a style that seems to have had more of a following in Europe this last decade than in the US (to our detriment, in my opinion). That said, I’m stoked that GENERACION SUICIDA has caught and maintained people’s attention and praise despite these inhospitable conditions characterized by hardcore fever. Hailing from the predominantly Latino area of South Los Angeles, their songs are all in Spanish. However, more than Spanish punk, their sound draws from Sweden’s the VICIOUS (as the band name would suggest), though the music is also comparable to AUTISTIC YOUTH, NEON PISS and YOUTH AVOIDERS. I really dig the infectious guitar leads on this record. My favorite track is “Rechazados por la Sociedad” — very, very catchy, melancholic punk, just the way I like it, with a chorus that reminds me of GORILLA ANGREB. Their lyrics in general deal with alienation and frustration with their surroundings—this song specifically references LA’s marginalized poor and homeless populations. My mind immediately goes to Skid Row (Sweden doesn’t have one of those!), very real. The record contains a dope fold-out poster insert with all the lyrics. Don’t sleep on this one!

MOIRA SCAR – Psychoid 12″
Being weird is a hard thing to synthesize. Being a weirdo is nearly impossible to impersonate. You’re either a weirdo naturally or you’re not. These days it feels like many bands are trying to artificially create weirdness, and when they do, it almost always resonates as shallow art school junk. However, when you come upon some true freaks and listen to and see the art they create…that’s the stuff that will set your mind on fire. Either positively or negatively (although sometimes it’s hard to tell which way you feel!). And that’s exactly what you’re getting with MOIRA SCAR. A wild hybrid of LYDIA LUNCH, goth, circus and space, all delivered in a cocktail that only a twisted mind could create. Is it punk? Does it make sense? These are the wrong questions to ask. It’s bizarre music for bizarre people. And it rules. Find your way to this record. (Cochon Records)

LOW THREAT PROFILE – Product #3 EP
Largely a recording project that spanned decades, this relatively recent (2010) recording of SoCal’s LOW THREAT PROFILE is simmered down to its core two-piece lineup of Bob from LACK OF INTEREST, BURN YOUR BRIDGES and INFEST on drums, and Matt Domino from INFEST and MANPIG on guitar and now handling the vocals. Masters of a stop-start genre that they both played a hand in creating and sustaining, there’s also a powerful ’80s feel to this. The absence of Andy Beattie on vocals is a little less noticeable with the MANPIG recording surfacing between the last LOW THREAT PROFILE releases. However, Matt’s vocals also make this session feel a little more personal, as they thoughtfully and directly rage — and I mean rage — against junkies, lethargic couch potatoes, racists, nostalgia, people wasting their lives, and more. More succinct production than their debut or MANPIG, these nine quick tracks don’t step in wide variation from their previous 12″ recording, as blast beats and rapid-fire vocals drive intense thrash blasts, cornered with rock-solid, mid-tempo, fast-guitar-driven hardcore. The leads have an awesome bred-and-born-in-the-’80s quality, with their indirect, vague osmosis of BLACK FLAG, ’80s SoCal straightedge and some angular late ’80s/’90s post-hardcore rock abrasion, all springboarding into violent 60-second thrash fits. Awesome! Don’t make us wait so long for the next installment! (Deep Six/Draw Blank)

“Belgium is a mess. And that’s not half bad!” spits Yves Lafere before an anthemic guitar creeps in, finally breaking out into what can and should only be considered a Punk with a capital “P” classic! From the catchy riffing to the biting, emphasized vocals and jittery drums that seem to want to race ahead, “Bloody Belgium” is to P.I.G.Z. what “Blitzkrieg Bop” was to the RAMONES: an emblematic magnum opus epitomizing their sound and aesthetic. “Is this Democracy, or is this blindness?” he chastises and squeals, everything sounding charismatically shambolic but utterly electrified. On the flip, “Stooges” slams in with an attitude-filled riff, not unlike the way “God Save the Queen” does, and has a distinctly heavy tone akin to that of the STOOGES or MC5, with steel-hard chords and Lafere snarling, “Too many problems in my life, too many problems ’cause I wanna be me!” Closer “Shall I” is the snottiest of the lot, a short, severe, hand-clapping reaction to societal expectations and identity frustration—timeless teenage rampage! JW’s Records originally pressed these three crown jewels of Belgian punk to a 12″ after the band won first place in 1978’s First Belgian Punk Contest, and they were rereleased once again by German Payola Records that same year. Both are apparently rare as fuck, so Ugly Pop has done us all a massive favor and made these three perfectly p-u-n-k masterpieces available yet again; remastered and packaged beautifully, with pictures, reprints of newspaper clippings and an intro text framing this seminal, absolutely essential record.

From the stock of legendary Bristol anarchopunk, a style that is emulated over and over, comes this new LP from GRAND COLLAPSE which is the most uncontrived, unexpected bright D-beat thrash that the punk rock timeline has to offer. There are even blackened melodies underneath proficient PROPAGHANDI-style riffage, creating an excellent genre mash-up for what is basically an anarcho-punk album. The strangulated vocals are spat out like a rabid Templeton at the veritable smorgasbord. The vocal pitch reminds me of Bay Area contemporaries ELEGY, actually. The production is perfect. The musicianship of GRAND COLLAPSE is so skilled that they cannot be pegged down to any one clichéd style. The heavy D-beat under flailed-out endless chords, into bellowing NYHC beatdown styles, will make you want to retrace those steps like a book you just skimmed over and felt like you missed a lot of what was going on. Then you will relax and enjoy something new. This album really has everything. Melody, angst and attitude, and does not let up for a moment. Heart, soul, guts and brains. I predict every band is going to want GRAND COLLAPSE on their tour. Far From the Callous Crowd is destined to be a classic. I’m very proud to have done the interview layout for GRAND COLLAPSE and now to be able to review the proficiency and vehemence behind their convictions. This is how you pole-vault the sound system.

FRAU write songs like the inside of your brain — fragmented, wild spurts of genius and disgust, an embodiment of the freedom that punk could be but rarely ever is. Frantic and charged, like the first NURSE flexi meets “Girl on the Run” but with a TEENAGE JESUS AND THE JERKS “fuck you” swagger. In short, yes, this band is the first, last, and best — the only punk band. They’re totally falling apart, but so fucking together at the same time, you could dance to this or collapse to it. It’s got this earth shattering quality, the feeling of a million ideas, but also a sneering nihilism… London really does have the coolest bands right now. I think every member of FRAU is in at least three other bands I love, and yet they still make this essential.

I’m guessing that this (almost) ten-year-old recording is just now seeing the light of day because Tony Molina’s solo shit has recently been blowing up. Whatever the reasoning, I’m glad to hear it because this shit rules. OVENS is a San Francisco band that Molina and friends have played in for years that, like Molina’s solo work, incorporates the best elements of the FASTBACKS (one of the best bands in the world) and THIN LIZZY while smashing them down into bite-size bits. The results are some phenomenally catchy, shred-tastic jams. The instrumental outro on the A-side sounds like a direct rip-off of the BEATLES song “I Want You (She’s So Heavy)” which is fine by me since that song is sick as fuck. If you like guitar-heavy, super-pop FASTBACKS-worship, you’ll wanna snatch this up if you see it. First pressing is gone, second is rumored to be on the way.

Hoooly shit! I’ve always loved me some PROTESTANT, but this new record is something else entirely, departing from their well-honed dark hardcore attack to embrace the hateful, raw filth of black metal. Cory’s unmistakable vocals (and the occasional massive breakdown) provide a link to the band’s previous discography, and the throat-ripping fury of metalpunk is definitely there, but they’ve rebuilt their sound from the ground up with some deliciously lo-fi production. The whole thing is overflowing with jaw-dropping riffs, played with the passion and precision of a band a decade into their existence. Easily one of the top black metal/crust crossovers I’ve heard—and believe me, I’ve heard far too many in the last several years. I would have to say that this is also PROTESTANT’s best, most consistent full-length to date. Trends come and go, but In Thy Name is the real deal. An instant classic.

In the years since their instantly classic and universally lauded first EP, the punks behind TERCER MUNDO have relocated from Monterrey (epicenter of the Mexican drug wars) to Mexico City (a place with plenty of its own problems—and also the subject of this month’s scene report). Their 12″ isn’t quite as in-your-face as that record (which famously featured a photo of a naked, legless female corpse, shot in the chest and captioned with the phrase “Mexico 2012—60,000 human beings dead. Now go party and score some cocaine.”) but it doesn’t have to be. They got your attention. This is more subtle, but no less incendiary. I can’t help but think of Presionados, the 1989 LP by XENOFOBIA, who also hailed from Mexico City. The cover of that record featured los cerdos facing an angry mob, fists in the air; the back of this one has a lone man pelting a rock at a wall of faceless cops. In 30 years, how little has changed—in fact, it seems like things have only gotten worse. “Espero llegar al día / Que acabe esta pesadilla.” TERCER MUNDO take elements of classic Mexican hardcore and make them their own—they pick up the pace, put blistering guitar leads and solos on top. Bile drips off the vocals, provided by Dave Rata (of RATAS DEL VATICANO), who seems to be the primary songwriter here, also playing bass and guitar on these recordings. A contender for record of the year, it comes in a hand-screened sleeve, with a risograph printed insert with lyrics in both Spanish and English. Pick this one up while you can. (Cintas Pepe)

Recorded in 1983 in Valladolid, Spain, mastered 30 years later right here in California, and released shortly after by the Mallorca-based Metadona Records, this legendary punk tape has finally been properly dignified in the vinyl format. Like their contemporaries in Spain, you can tell their sound resulted from simultaneously digesting both first wave punk and proto-hardcore, recalling a bit of CICATRIZ and KANGRENA, but also the gloomy side of PARALISIS PERMANENTE. However, while exuding darkness, QLOAQA LETAL is not campy, just genuinely creepy and candidly cynical about their social reality: “Life spits on me, luck deceives me, glory avoids me, death grabs me.” While becoming a classic of the Punk Ibérico repository, they definitely developed their own sound here and it’s amazing! The bass pulsing percussively over a crudely fuzzy guitar tone, Rouky’s warm and gritty vocals, as well as the intriguing electronic sound of the manual drum kit are all elements that make this stand out in their time period. Furthermore, they often infused their live shows with elements of theatrical plays. The package includes an insert with lyrics and photo clippings from the period showing their wonderful freak aesthetic, and prompting me to shudder thinking about what it must have been like walking around conservative Valladolid in the early ’80s looking like that. Possibly attributable to LA BANDA TRAPERA DEL RIO, the word cloaca (sewer) and its associated imagery became a Spanish punk signifier, which one could interpret as a message reminding the new pseudo-democratic regime obsessed with cleaning its own image that the shit still has to go somewhere. Awesome record and a cool artifact. (Metadona Records)

“Too smart for their own sake”: Toronto’s ACTUAL WATER


Published  August 22, 2014 By MRR

Reviews 



By George Lastman
How smart is too smart? How funny is too funny? For Actual Water, the answers to these questions are not mutually exclusive. To them, being Toronto’s resident “musically inclined intellectuals” (their words, not mine) goes hand in hand with being jokers of the scene. It seems natural to Actual Water that their lyrics, hefty in theme and resplendent in undergrad-informed verbosity, ride simple, guitar-driven tracks that simply rock. Still, there remains a sort of roundabout danger and uniqueness to the boys, as they prefer to do things like conduct interviews in very un-rock situations, e.g., in a public library.
Anthony Nemet, 24, enters the room in a brown blazer and well-fitting jeans. Sitting gracefully in the largest chair in the building, he crosses his legs and squints at a copy of Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds by Charles Mackay. A 19th century text exploring phenomena as wide-ranging as economic bubbles and alchemy, the text is both sensational and academic at once, almost as useful as it is thrilling and accessible. Watching the lead singer and Rickenbacker-swinger of one of Toronto’s most inscrutable rock bands read such a heavy tome could be disorienting, but Nemet is quick to clear up any questions about what he’s into what he’s into.
“This is a key text when trying to understand the psychosis people feel when confronted by rock ‘n’ roll,” Anthony says, looking down his nose at me. “Let’s be honest, what is a rock show if not an expression of mass hysteria?” He pauses, laughs, and looks over at Gary Pooni, 24, his friend and partner in songcraft. Clutching a copy of Malcolm Gladwell’s The Tipping Point, Pooni concurs with a nod, a smile and shrug of the shoulders, his body language suggesting that Nemet go on. The room goes silent as the two return to their books.

It’s not easy to interview Actual Water. They often go off on tangents, talk over each other and speak in big words that rarely, if ever, make much sense. Pooni seems especially eager to confound anyone within earshot with his verbal dexterity. As drummer, percussionist and lyricist of the group, Pooni clearly wishes to loom large among other “intelligent drummers who write songs” like Neil Peart and Traffic’s Jim Capaldi. Speaking in measured sentences punctuated by rapid-fire invective as well as frequent use of alliteration and free-associative metaphor, Pooni speaks as if he is constantly trying to remind you of how smart he is. Rather than reading as a symptom of insecurity, it seems to be more of a giant joke that is always on the verge of going over my head. Still, when he needs to make a point, he does so with brevity.
“Look, the point is to make a record that makes you think and doesn’t stink.” He says as he leans forward, looking me dead in the eye and taking on a conspiratorial air. “All these other bands, most of them anyway, all they’re interested in is having a good time, shooting the shit and leaving the heavy intellectual work to the next guy. The next guy, of course, is a chimp who doesn’t want to do anything but play asinine riffs through a Big Muff.” His face goes grim for a moment before a smile cracks and he glances over at Nemet who also can’t help but laugh. Right as I feel like I’m starting to get the joke, however, Pooni flips the script. “I mince garlic,” he says, “not words. I hate to say it, but rock bands nowadays are just getting dumber”.
At times, Actual Water’s façade breaks down and you see them for what they are: two kids from Toronto who love making controversial statements about the politics of rock almost as much as they love the music itself. Their songs, acting as an outlet for this aggression against bands (no specific names mentioned) that they deride as being “chimps, chumps, chicken and not fit to chauffer an Actual Water roadie to Coachella”, often read as rock ‘n’ roll think pieces, both in form and content. They’re also fond of using terms like “entry-level” to place groups in a hierarchical structure that places Actual Water at the top, as if they have been appointed (or anointed) CEOs of modern guitar music. The end result of this barrage of invective is that the band appears holier-than-thou and narcissistic. Still, when you see them crack up, you begin to wonder if they actually believe any of what they’re saying.

Name-calling and bullshit politics aside, the group’s latest album, Call 4 Fun, is exactly what its name implies. “It’s a fun record. It’s like the best alcohol rock party you’ve ever been to at Foucault’s mansion,” says Nemet as he leans back, closing his book and placing a gold bookmark between its worn pages. “The idea of ‘calling for fun’ is putting the onus on both the listener and the band. You better know what numbers to dial.” Indeed, the title track is a thrilling stab at joyous guitar pop that isn’t far removed from early 2000s garage rock. Later in the record, on the beautifully dark dirge of “Waldo Jackson,” a reference is made to the titular character “falling out of his tree onto a stack of old NMEs”. When asked to connect the dots, Pooni and Nemet smile. Relishing the opportunity to talk about two of his favourite things at once, Pooni explains that Waldo Jackson is a “tired, whiney old indie guy who lives in the ‘90s and can’t get it up long enough to stop thinking about guitar tones and start having a good time.” Fair play.
There they are: rock politics. They creep up once again, as they often do with Actual Water, but almost always with humour. True to their status as jokers who love a good conceptual gag, the difficult inside jokes keep coming. They accumulate in front of me, piled high like paperwork in a language I don’t understand and can’t make any sense of. As it becomes more and more difficult to tell when they’re taking me for a ride, their music becomes more and more revealing. Still, when they really need to make a point, they make sure you know they’re serious. Actual Water’s mission is inject excitement into rock by any means necessary, even if that means doing decidedly un-rock things, like reading Gladwell in a library on a weekend. They want nothing more than to bring a pulse back to a genre that’s been lagging since Julian Casablancas started singing falsetto.
Of course, when I make this Strokes reference to the group, they go serious. Nemet insists that his falsetto is “the most beautiful sound you’ll ever hear.” Pooni adds that listeners “cannot yet afford to hear him sing in his nightingale register.” I try to read their body language to see if they’re joking and feel as if I’m floating aimlessly in the middle of a Chomsky text without an intellectual paddle. They’ve done it to me again, and they’ll do it to you as soon as you play Call 4 Fun. I’ve gotten used to it, and I don’t regret it. Neither will you, trust me.

Handle with care, this is fuggin’ deadly. Göteborg’s CONTORTURE goes straight for the jugular with their raging feminist käng, expertly toeing the raw/melodic line that has come to define Swedish crust in the last decade. Lyrics revisit familiar themes of autonomy, rape culture, and watching those around you age out of punk, but with a personalistic approach, and the lead vocals remind me of Kate from SCHIFOSI in all the best ways. On the flip, leading Canadian powerviolence freex AHNA lays out two more doses of their noisey blackened filth, sounding yet again like they’ve managed to record in one of the lesser pits of hell. This is actually a lot less blast-centric than their older material, with crusty rhythms offsetting the murky metalloid gloom, and the opening sludge of “Living in Fear” channels the headbanging glory of BOLT THROWER to perfection. Already a serious contender for my favorite split of 2014, this is nothing short of mandatory for all you metalpunx.

Two guitars with the fastest picking imaginable, making sure you hear the full extent of each riff, filling out the sound perfectly. The drums pierce through the high frequencies of the guitars and vocals, keeping hard time better than you ever thought possible.

After my recent fascination with ’80s French Oi! and coldwave, here comes something equally interesting, one to add to my list of grande musique de France: keyboard-, drum- and bass-driven synthpunk right out of current day Grenoble! I love everything about this release: the mixed bag of influences (punk, post-punk, electro, hip hop, Renaissance music!) the subtle cinematic orchestration, the layout of the inner sleeve and silk screened Miró-esque cover. The almost church organ-like keyboard tunes steal the show, sounding like they’re coming from some busted up old ’60s synth, wafting and weaving through the tight, minimal yet animated drumming (kick, floor tom, snare and hi-hat), the soulful rhythms of the bass (that fullness of jazz, that spike of punk, that slight funk edge) and the attitude-filled vocals (with that poeticism that the French language inherently possesses). The backing vocal harmonies leave a ’60s psych garage aftertaste, but the keyboard and vocals really manage to set a multitude of tones and moods to real-life settings (suffocation, depression, drunken mirth, traveling, crushes, loss, sexual mistakes). There is a sense of humour (even mockery) to the performance, and the A-side almost sounds as if a bunch of punks got together in a brick basement (upon Roman ruins for all I know) to write a soundtrack to the urban comedy/drama they call life. Don’t let that playful attitude fool you though; the darker B-side ends the show on a morose tone, where disappointment and disillusion abound; a bad trip confession set to music. Bitter yet sweet, magical yet haunted, vintage yet moderne. Fucking brilliant! Get it!

Following their excellently abominable 2013 demo, FEMACOFFIN continues to break new crust ground with anguish, crux and blood-curdling sincerity. What I most appreciate about this band is their no-fucks-given tempo. The overall haplessness of this recording does not give a shit what you or your scene expects from a punk band. There is that kind of awesome respect when you hear FEMACOFFIN live, as well. If I may: hear this risen from the ashes of STORMCROW as AXEWIELD was spewed from EFFIGY. As if either needed be improved upon, yet here they are. Side one dooms the mood with “Dismal Twilight,” a four-minute bulldozer. Side two: “Trinity” quickens the pace with additional metal riffs. You can’t get much better than the vocal dynamic between Brian and Tony. A ghostly, brief, guitar solo depresses further into their music void of optimism. This is truly saturated, septic crust punk. A spaced-out sample mid-side reminds me of AMEBIX “The Moor,” straight into the best ICONS OF FILTH cover ever: “Midnight.” Absolutely ripping drum fills here. Holy shit, this cover fucking rules! Beautiful stipple artwork by Stiv of VISIONS OF WAR, hand lettered insert, profound lyrics, great production; this is a must have debut EP for any crust resurger out there.

¡En español! Una entrevista a DHK en la Maximum Rocknroll #355

Ah yes! One of the best bands to come out of Peru right now! After Odio los Discos and La Vida Es Un Mus, Hysteria Records carries the torch and releases yet another great slab of wax by these sonic-destructo punks! Raw, blown out, primal and heavy D-beat with Spanish stylings and lots of bellowing, distorted bass (I can almost hear the walls rumble!). Political lyrics and brash vocals command you to pay attention, with simple yet effective chunky riffs that fill out the racketing drums as they career and gallop around your head without cease. It’s funny how some bands try exceptionally hard to get this rough and gruff sound, and then others just ooze it naturally. I think it has more to do with the social and political circumstances that spawned DHK and their sound, and less to do with the actual style of music played, because there is something so genuine to be found here, it’s inspiring. “What future is we are waiting for?” There’s a level of meaning distilled, an ingrained authenticity and a connection to the grievances of life that other releases simply don’t have—or at least they’re not as legit as this. Stand out tracks are “Kasta Kuando” and “Por Ke Soy Punk” with a melancholic riff that makes my skin crawl. You could stick to your hyped, gimmick hardcore farce-bands, or you could listen to this and feel the force. Comes in an über-råpunk silk screened cover—highly recommended.

Right out of the gate, this compilation of Berlin punk/hardcore bands kills. BITTER CROP plays a straightforward mid-tempo punk song that was over before I could finish typing that sentence. Their song is pissed and would be a perfect fit on any punk mixtape. MÜLLTÜTE blasts through their style of completely perfect, totally fucking pissed hardcore that it catchy as fuck. I love them. NUCLEAR CULT almost approaches grind speeds, but then settles into a slow stoner-style breakdown that ends before you can light up that first toke. EARTH CRUST DISPLACEMENT has a bit of a noisy Japanese hardcore/crust vibe. PEACEBASTARD plays straight up raging hardcore with a singer going so full throttle that they’re sure to have some throat problems later in life. PIG// CONTROL rages the shit out of some blazing “no fucking control” German hardcore. CRACK UNDER PRESSURE is blast-beat mania and reminds me a little bit of SPAZZ if they didn’t have a sense of humor. This comp is a perfect snapshot of the Berlin hardcore scene right now and flies by in a matter of minutes, which is wonderful for people like me who feel like hardcore should always be short, fast and loud as fuck.

There’s an urgency in the first chord and drum hit that just sucks me in immediately, similar to the way the OBSERVERS LP did. I never spent much time with OBEDIENCIA’s first EP, but I love their song on the Sound the Alarms!! comp, and the second track on this EP is just as strong — upbeat, danceable, with brilliant vocal hooks. The vocalist is what really carries this band; she’s so soulful and confident. That shit is cranked right up front, almost too loud, but it totally works. Don’t get me wrong, the instrumentation is great too, but the singing pushes this band to the top. My critique has to be the slight distortion on the vocals, which gives the whole thing a little garage quality. Not a bad thing, I just personally prefer more organic vocals, especially when the singer is this great. Add a little reverb instead of the distortion and let that vocal track soar! Just one guy’s opinion. Otherwise this EP is perfect, and the more I listen, the more I like!

Socio-political melodic/pop-punk from Spain. Wait, sorry, really amazing socio-political melodic/pop-punk from Spain. If it wasn’t for the fact that the lyrics are in Spanish, I wouldn’t have been surprised if you told me this band came up through the New Brunswick, NJ basement scene—or at least were from somewhere on the East Coast. Equal parts melodic hardcore and straight up pop-punk, with beautiful vocals by Blanca. All of this together sounds like something in between the earnest swagger and jangle of the MEASURE [SA] and WORRIERS and the infectious, angered energy of LA FRACTION—or maybe like the too short-lived Syracuse band NO CONNECTION. The liner notes have the lyrics in the original Spanish, along with English translations—always awesome. The lyrical content is especially great. While most anarcho punk bands are simply anti-this and anti-that, and most pop-punk bands are just, “I love my friends and partying,” ACCIDENTE splits those sentiments right down the middle. “Que motivos no son pocos amistad y rebelion (There are plenty of reasons to fight for friendship and rebellion).” If you like bands like RVIVR ’cause they’re injecting a little social thought and politics into the current pop-punk scene, you’ll love this. I just listened to this record five times in a row, and I’m only getting more and more into it.

Fittingly named after a suburban toll road in their native Melbourne, EASTLINK eloquently reconfigures the repetitive driving-on-the-Autobahn feel of, say, NEU! 75 until it suits the local atmosphere. Starting with a riff—insidious, relentless and intelligently thuggish, so classically Orstralian—the all guitar sound swaggers and swings like a pub emptying out after last call. On first listen VENOM P STINGER attempting the motorik beat came to mind, but this is not a “if you like this you’ll love that” type of sound, and I feel like I am beating my hands against the keyboard in an ape like fashion attempting to articulate the pleasures and pains of this disc! The tape that preceded this LP was one of my most listened to things of the past year, soundtracking my banal endless existence walking home after another night shift in retail-land, through desolate skyscrapers and emptied out streets. This record took me a bit longer to warm to, I think because it’s not quite as relentless/claustrophobic/total; there’s some space and even, uh, space rock on certain tracks. The lyrics are fragmented and political, questioning in a thoughtful perceptive style that seems so much more authentic than another prepackaged slice of anarcho pie. The fact that seemingly every person in a decent/exciting band in Australia is in fifty other equally decent/exciting bands is quite humbling. EASTLINK features people from TOTAL CONTROL, UV RACE, LAKES and probably thirty other bands, and they are fucking great. Another genius group sounding the death knell of the neoliberal dream.

Okay, so THE SECRET PROSTITUTES are from Texas and sing in English, Spanish, what seems to be either Swedish or Norwegian, but mostly in Indonesian. Oh, and they cover a song in Italian. And the record is from Finland. +2 points. They play tightly wound rock ’n’ roll that has one foot in punk, one foot in garage and is pissing on the line in between. +2 points. They prefer to stylize their band name with SS lightning bolts. –2 points (one for each). “Galaxie” is an amazing, weird pop song that comes out of nowhere and breaks up the record perfectly. +1 point. They seem to have a fascination with Communism (they cover CCCP FEDELI ALLA LINEA, and have a song “Partai Komunis Indonesia”— which roughly translates to “Communist Party Indonesia”—and another titled “Kalashnikov” with a Cold War sample). No points given/taken away. When I saw them live (just after first hearing this record) the guitarist was wearing a G.G. ALLIN shirt (–1) and the bassist was wearing a SPACEMEN 3 shirt (+1). So let’s see… a total score of… who fucking cares! Who actually keeps score in punk anyway?! This is a totally ripping record with some really fucking cool vocals.

Record of the Week: ROSS JOHNSON AND JEFFREY EVANS Vanity Session LP

Lemme fill you hobos in on some key facts before we tackle the platter at hand. ROSS JOHNSON, former co-conspirator of famed goons like TAV FALCO and ALEX CHILTON, has littered a slew of legendary records with his simplistic, drunken poetics and semicompetent drumming. JEFFREY EVANS’ legend looms large in the record collections of a great many beefy American rockers, having fronted the criminally underappreciated units known as GIBSON BROS and 68 COMEBACK, specializing in rock ’n’ roll injected with truth serum and scholarly smarts. These guys rate really goddamn high in my book, so I’m on board and beer number three before even dropping the tone arm.
Vanity Session, their aptly named dream-team debut, is the product of a year’s worth of late nights spent serenading town drunks around Memphis, Tennessee. The vibe is pure barroom, only with this royal duo holding court, chatting your ear off, leering at ladies in younger demographics and obliterating rock ’n’ roll to its most basic and deviant levels. Johnson’s bop is next-level genius shit here, no joke. It’s impossible to pull a specific quote or drunken riff to single out because the flow is so goddamn perfect that you never want it to end. Think you’ve heard all that could ever be done with a standard such as “Girl Watcher?” Think again! Ridiculous! Evans keeps things firmly grounded musically, which ain’t an easy task considering the substances rumored to be afloat during the sessions (ARTHER LEE’s weed?!). Add the capable backing of TEARJERKERS and REIGNING SOUND personnel, not to mention genius producer Jim Dickinson steering the ship (his turn fronting the boys for “I’ve Had It” is jaw-dropping!!!) and you have an absolute can’t-miss record, the sort that is all too rare in this day and age. It’s already become the soundtrack to my stay-home weeknight drunks… those kinda nights where you rationalize drinking toward blindness because your day off is only X hours away.
Vanity Session simply spills over with charm, sounding lecherous, intelligent and highly rockin’ all at once. It’s real rock ’n’ roll music, and it’s been too long since you last heard it.

Every once in a while, maybe like three times in the past five years or something, I get a record for review where I spend the whole time staring at the record player, wide eyed and jaw dropped. This is so amazing I think I’m having a panic attack. It starts out in this total jazz drugs chaos that’s some kind of space between mutant disco and noise and everything is happening at once. It almost sounds like three or four amazing songs just layered on top of each other. The vocals manage to have input from rage growls, soft singing and bratty chants all at the same time. JAILBIRD Y‘s instrumentation keeps as close is it can to some kind of CONTORTIONS freak disco funk while being the cleanest chaos I’ve heard in a while. The second track switches over to some harsh drone out of nowhere but it all makes perfect sense. Like being at a nuts party where everyone’s talking and then you go outside and it’s just silence and moonlight. This is so genius. The second side pales in comparison but I kind of feel like almost anything would, it dives back into the freak disco funk arena but then has these weird melodic parts that verge into, like, RITES OF SPRING or something and I’m kind of like, “What the fuck are you doing?” but it’s still killer. Also, there is this hilarious chill acoustic guitar riff at the very end, I’m pretty sure I laughed out loud. My mind is blown, my mind is blown. (Love Over Voltage Records)

This is what a perfect record sounds like. Every time I talk about it I end up sounding like some blubbering idiot. This music is equal parts post-punk, incantation and psych—hook laden as fuck. RATKA is an all-female band from São Paulo, Brazil, that seem to have come from out of nowhere to make most of the current post-punk/anarcho wave completely irrelevant. This is the next level in this style, borrowing elements from all the spooky classics, but adding something so undeniably new and unique that the game is permanently changed. RAKTA eliminates all sense of retro-ness to the style and come off like they just now invented the damn thing. The songs create an otherworldly atmosphere while still keeping your feet tapping. It transports you to this weird dimension that feels like it’s trying to keep you inside of it forever. It would have been the perfect soundtrack for a Maya Deren film. The record comes with a red-and-black on white poster that only adds to the mysterious bruxa vibes that the music gives. Check out my year-end top ten list in MRR #370 for even more gushing about this record. Highest recommendation! (Dama Da Noite Discos / Nada Nada Discos)

Oakland’s NEGATIVE STANDARDS turn in their best slab yet for this split. Despair-laden ambiance and a welcome return to the effective use of samples (an art seemingly left in 1998) crashes headfirst into a full frontal downtuned assault that puts absolutely everything on the table. Their power is in their diversity—both within tracks and between them. File this amongst heavyweights like COUNTERBLAST and SYSTRAL, with notable nods to modern black metal and gratuitous forays into noise interludes. On the flipside, Australia’s long-running doom masters WHITEHORSE do exactly what they do best: they crush you. A full side is sacrificed to one song, an exercise in patience and torture. Painfully slow devastation is tempered with electronic sound manipulations that eventually become the focal point instead of a mere distraction, as key to the overall impact as the guttural vocal bursts that sound like they are being removed from the singer as much as delivered by him. Whirlwind guitar leads start at about the six-minute mark—every time you submit, they add more torment. Dismiss this as another doom band record if you like, but it will be your loss.  (Vendetta Records)

These maniacs were on the West Coast this past summer, so I pretty much knew what to expect when I dropped the needle…but holy shit is all I can say. A fastcore/powerviolence masterpiece of the highest order, COMPLETED EXPOSITION blasts through twenty tracks on this one-sided slab. Hyperactive Japanese thrash and crushing lows that serve to do little but give you time to breathe before the next installment of fury. I cannot imagine how a band writes this shit; dual vocals and song structures that absolutely defy comprehension. It’s almost impossible to mindlessly rock out while listening — Structure Space Mankind demands complete concentration. This is mind-melting otherworldly psychedelic grind, futuristic fastcore, a legitimately amazing wake-up call to an entire subgenre. “We will continue to search for insatiable quest for Powerviolence. Advance to the next stage, advance to the new dissonance world.” (625 Thrash/Psychocontrol)

Never Mind the Taqwacores Here Is the Real Deal compilation 7″
Of course I’m fascinated by this compilation of Pakistani bands. I want to know to what extent expatriates versus native Pakistanis are involved in these bands and scene(s). Unfortunately, for the bands that do have contact information, some of the links (to Facebook) seem inoperable. Scoping the others didn’t answer my questions, so I’m still ignorant. From listening to the comp I can tell you metal and grind are big influences. MARG gives us a bouncy, mid-tempo track with languid vocals and some noodly guitar leads. The lyrics (translated into English) critique society. CORNHOLE‘s track, “Beards in Power,” is catchy enough through the verses, losing something on the chorus. BVLGHVM plays a standard nasty grind with rather short songs. CHOOTS (which apparently translates as “vaginas,” though any subtleties there may be lost on me) play a quick, fast metal track, with the vocals dominating over the music. “There isn’t a tunnel with fucking light, ain’t no pearly gates, ain’t no Satan to torture you, there is nothing.” MULTINATIONAL CORPORATION plays a heavy grind attacking religion with lyrics in English and a native language. FORESKIN precede their track with what I believe is a sample of the BAD BRAINS, before attacking “faggots” who don’t headbang. “Break those mental barriers and run to the fucking front.” This song is about 25 seconds long. GLORIFIED WHORE MONGERS play some demo-quality metal, which I prefer to the work of BATHORY, who seem an influence. KAFIR E AZAM has a short, well-executed grind track. Overall I’m more excited about there being kids into metal and grind in Pakistan than I am for much of the music here, though a few of these songs I’d be glad to hear wherever they’d originated from.
—Jeff Mason

CHORNAYA RADUGA – All of Us Will Fly… EP
This 7″ appears on the always-interesting Tian An Men 89 Records, that has been putting out records by punks who live in parts of the world where they lack the resources to do it themselves. The label is celebrating its 20th anniversary this year. On this release, they bring us Bender’s (Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic) CHORNAYA RADUGA, who belts out four songs of post-metal that is informed by emotional hardcore and melodic punk. The first track, “War,” begins with a bomb siren and launches into a depressive, downtrodden song about the business of war. The other three songs delve deeper into the post-metal side of their sound and almost resembles nu-metal in a few moments, but those moments are (thankfully) brief. There are also some solid, confident guitar solos taking up a good chunk of time in these songs. This is a solid release for fans of this style.

This month our Record of the Week feature focuses on seven new releases from the amazing Tian An Men 89 Records label. For decades now, Luk Haas has traveled the most unreachable corners of the globe seeking out punk and underground rock scenes, and releasing music on Tian An Men 89 that the rest of the world would never otherwise get a chance to hear. The man is a true hero! 

BEIRUT SCUM SOCIETY/DETOX split EP
Punk from Lebanon! The first track on the BEIRUT SCUM SOCIETY side sounds like a slowed down FLAG OF DEMOCRACY’s “Madhouse.” The second song is more of a rock ‘n’ roll oldies/rockabilly, complete with harmonica, then the third continues in this vein with a more punk vibe to it, à la VIBRATORS with snotty vocals. DETOX reminds me of early 45 GRAVE with some RIK AGNEW-related moments, complete with keyboard. Then there is a hardcore jam that moshes into a punk breakdown mess in “Play a Fucking Instrument”—there is a lot going on here, but it’s cohesive and good. This definitely diverges from a path at times, but it’s firmly rooted in early ’80s punk, yet more aggressive than melodic—creative, weird and carnival-esque very early punk mixed with art punk shit, using irony and humor to address serious issues. I love the DETOX tracks on here, but the whole record is good and seriously solid if you wanna get weird…which I do.
—Mariam Bastani


MAZHOTT EP
Wow, writing about a Syrian punk band while shit is hitting the fan over there seems rather surreal. Tian An Men 89 has done it again, yet again delivering the goods! The first track has a street-punk beat that blends with a guitar solo that could only have been produced in the East: rich and intoxicating like pipe smoke or potent herbs. The second self-titled track sticks to a similar style, with some funky drumming and some cow-bell, while on the flip “Bakaloria” goes in a more rock ‘n’ roll direction, with choppy guitars and a dancey melody. The final track (“Sai’een”) is performed live and starts out with a ska-sounding guitar which turns into sad solo, accompanied by lyrics which I can tell are filled with pain, anger and sincerity. Who needs to speak a common language when you have music like this? A real gem that will be appreciated by anyone who understands what punk actually means, as opposed to (only) what it may sound like.

V/A – Disenfranchised in India compilation LP
Tian An Men 89‘s documentation of punk and alternative rock in far-flung corners of the world continues with its first-ever compilation of bands from India from the last decade. TAM89’s website contains a succinct explanation of its desire to document and encourage self-expression in different countries, whatever the permutations and definitions of alternative punk music people choose, regardless of styles and trends in the West. This does however collide with the mass globalization of punk and alternative music, by both major labels marketing to “emerging markets,” their use in Hollywood films that are distributed globally, and the internet allowing access to a clear idea of “what you’re supposed to do”… So there are sometimes less surprises than you’d hope for, as some band in Delhi basically regurgitates the ’90s Seattle grunge sound and NIRVANA or GREEN DAY, as those influences are sometimes more apparent than people with a vague idea left to just make up their own thing on a limited set of resources or ideas. Punk’s radical DIY template is its greatest victory, not the music, not the fashion or specific ideas, but the ability for people to take control of their own music, art and culture as an avenue for self expression—and there’s a great power in forwarding that in new places via these compilations, where bands can see their music pressed to vinyl, often for the first time, and exposed to a worldwide audience. But, despite the open-minded approach to punk, it’s still looking for a Western set of music values (the concept of punk itself) in a country that probably has way better local music that has nothing to do with punk or hardcore. Set that aside, the fourteen bands here each contribute one track with a lyric sheet and short history of each band, and there’re a lot of rewards here for the open minded not looking for a specific sound or result. The comp opens with one of its strongest tracks, by TRITHA ELECTRIC BAND—an eclectic trip-hop/ethno-punk artist from Kolkata who tours extensively in Europe, whose track here, “Fish Market,” is more of a punk-edged new wave stomper—like a hard TONI BASIL track but with the same infectious, bouncy fun and catchiness. JEEPERS CREEPERS play a catchy track of lo-fi indie rock, threaded around a solid spindling guitar line. BLAKHOLE cranks one of the comp’s few fast, noisy thrash blasts. BULL ENGINE approximates the aforementioned ’90s Sub Pop grunge sound, with a heavy Cobain-ish twang. Mumbai’s PUNK ON TOAST plays stripped down, garagey punk that is actually not too far off from, say, THEE HEADCOATS, but with ’80s-style boilerplate political lyrics and meek vocals. The RIOT PEDDLERS have a high-energy melodic hardcore sound that would be well at home in Orange County skateparks. The SCRATCH CARDS play solid, basic hard rock ‘n’ roll. TRIPWIRE plays jangly mid-tempo punk with a ’60s pop feel. And OUTLINERS end the comp with a dreamy, layered track reminiscent of one of the more subdued B-sides by the ENGLISH BEAT or SPECIALS, with its shuffling ska-ish guitar lines.

Chaos in Morocco compilation LP
Short review: Tian An Men 89 is the most important record label in the world for punks seeking international and (truly) underground punk bands, and you should seek out everything they release—period. As for this release specifically? Five Moroccan bands ranging from all out fist-pounding hardcore to commercial ska-punk. HOBA HOBA SPIRIT is perhaps the most interesting band: proto NWOBHM clashing with anthemic, folksy punk—a combination that I enjoy far more than the description might suggest. ZLAQ WELLA MOUT is perfect Hellcat Records fodder, perfectly executed anthemic street punk—the ska emphasis on the first track is tempered with the searing metallic vibe of “Ma Tssibch Ki Dir.” The PROTESTERS are in a similar vein; a future classic if there was any justice in the world, “I Wanna Protest” is the perfect political punk starter song. But the two bands that really kick my teeth in are W.O.R.M. (churning dual-vocal hardcore that just screams for a circle pit) and RIOT STONES (rough, primal street punk proving perfection in simplicity, their two songs alone would make for an indispensable 45). You might think that punk is whatever little bubble of cool that you find yourself in, but punk is so much bigger. So. Much. Bigger.
—Robert Collins



Suriname Punks Meet Guyana Punks compilation EP
From the new batch of TAM89 releases (you bet your ass I already mail-ordered all seven of them) come three bands from two neighboring countries on the northern coast of South America (I actually didn’t know, had to look them up). DE ROTTE APPELS from Suriname kick it off with a very ’77 UK punk sounding jam with an anthemic chorus and an overall poppy feel to it. Country-mates ADHD are doing a similar style but with a looser approach and some seemingly more modern influences. On the flip you get KEEP YOUR DAY JOB from Guyana doing some solid, polished melodic punk with a very epic feel. They employ a mesmerizing guitar lead topped off with over-articulate English lyrics, kinda like PROPAGHANDI. A very cool peek into some obscure punk. The overall recording production is quite a bit more slick and digital than past TAM89 releases—a true sign of the times that technology is connecting punks from all corners of the globe, while digital recording programs are apparently easily accessible almost everywhere.

Jeezus, I really wasn’t expectin’ this. When I saw these guys in NYC a few years back, they didn’t really knock my socks off, but this LP sure does. Unlike the current crop of NY bands, CONCRETE CROSS includes folks who have been at it for more than a few years. And it really shows, because there’s a lot going on in these songs—searing leads, nuanced song structures and some cool interplay between the instruments—yet they execute it with a raging dexterity that few hardcore bands (in the States, at least) can match. I’m reminded of a number of metallic- yet-thoroughly-punk bands of old—particularly Animosity era COC and Return of Martha Splatterhead era ACCUSED (especially the vocals)—but no comparisons really hit the mark, as the complete package shines with a personality all its own. CONCRETE CROSS may not be one of the cool bands in New York’s fast-paced—and, dare I say, trendy?—punk scene, but they’re excellent and I hope this review sees them getting recognition for this impressive LP.

In 1917 Marcel Duchamp presented an unassuming object to an exhibition and declared it “high art.” The urinal he submitted, titled “Fountain” (and now seen as a major landmark of 20th century art) was initially dismissed as trash and removed. On Teenage Rattlesnakes the TRASHIES explore the lineage of Duchamp (not explicitly) and reinterpret the notion of “trash as art.” Teenage Rattlesnakes is the sound of the TRASHIES deviating from the more straightforward and upbeat new wave, white trash, celebratory, satirical anthems of “Taz Tattoo” or “I’m High, So What” toward the art damaged no-rock swagger of UZI RASH (with which this band shares members) and finds a middle ground between catchy garage new wave and art damage. The band also further distances itself from music that is at first listen, immediately evocative of the SPITS. What you have here is a more mature, thoughtful progression down a trip to the dump in which the blue tarp has been thematically replaced by songs about (among other things) various means of trash and bug consumption. While they’ve chosen to mine this new found art-gunk territory they still excel at writing songs that are catchy and conventionally accessible, but which sound unconventional and unique. The dub sound explored in Space Jam reappears on this outing in the form of the autobiographically rich “I Ate the Trash” and is perhaps the most accessible and fun song on the album. Teenage Rattlesnakes firmly reinforces the notion that trash, in the hands of the right people, becomes compelling. (1-2-3-4 Go!)

Damn, what to say first about this record? That it is era-defining? That it’s the first record you should seek out if you want to know anything about early Greek punk? That it put Greece on the punk map? That it shaped the sound of Greek punk to come after it? All of the above are true yet, like with any definitive regional compilation, unless you were there, or at least lived to experience its legacy and after-effect, little can sum up its true significance. Each one of these six bands sounds different yet the common thread running throughout them all is so strong, it’s proof of music’s ability to forge and reflect a collective consciousness.
ADIEXODO’s “Nightmare” is so well-embedded within Greek punk minds that the mere sound of its opening bass-line can conjure a whole whirlwind of emotions. Their second offering (“Isolation”), is equally influential, with its raw and gritty sound, its growling vocals and despairing lyrics. The EX-HUMANS song (“Blinding Light”) perfectly captures the empty ideals that fell apart (“the only truth is death, the hope of life is a lie”) while “Suicide in Slow Motion” is another sound-defining track of fuzzed guitars, creeping melodies and painful songwriting—not just with their lyrics, but with their ability to seize a whole generation’s misery into a handful of notes. GENIA TOU HAOUS follows, with their intoxicating, dismal sound. “Bastardokratia” has evolved from old punk gem to classic street-battle anthem to the definitive pièce de résistance of anti-authoritarian Greek youth, reflecting everything that is and has been wrong about the unjust, surreal land called Greece.
Moving on to the B-Side, GROVER sings a song that every Greek punk who has ever been drafted for their military service can relate to: “In the army, the razor give you no hope. Here is hell, here is desolate. Here you are alone, leave, go far away.” The negative sentiments continue with two PANX ROMANA classics, “Greeks” (“long live delusions!”) and “Athens” (“I want to leave this city, I want to leave this hell, I’m looking for a solution, but no one can help me. Athens, a ghost city, Athens, a ghetto city, Athens, a concrete jungle, Athens, a city with a past but no future.”) To close off this mind-blowing slab of wax is Athens’ godfathers of punk, STRESS, with their timeless homages to freedom (“Right to Life”) and anxiety (“Aghos”).
A truly great compilation speaks truth where there is none. And the truth about Greek punk is that it has a stoic, almost poetic quality that transcends style and form, and instead captures the essence of societal depression and youthful despair—both still so very damn relevant today. This record brings tears to my eyes and its impact could never be summed up in mere words.

How can something be vicious and charming at once?! I heard the hit “I Wanna Make a Fanzine” sometime last year and, as seems to always be the case, the tapes were gone by the time I figured out how to get one. A bored sounding girl lists the things she is gonna put in her fanzine, with a snarled chorus “I wanna wanna wanna make a fanzine” true bedroom punker style. My heart stops; Spanish punx wasting time in an English coastal town by creating a bold and exciting sound… It’s got that Manchester Musicians Collective/John Peel show circa 1981 quality, handmade and earnest but not twee or throwaway like a lot of the C-86 drek, IRREPARABLES play with a true radical punk rock heart. The bare-bones punk soul of DEAD MOON meets the MARINE GIRLS!? Heartfelt songs about mix tapes may sound like the opposite of fun, but if I told you Teo of FIRMEZA10 fame was part of this endeavor and also one or two of the women from LAS TIMIDAS, (who put out the tape of the year last year[!!] which is also getting a vinyl reissue courtesy of some Hackney type) you might at least give it a listen?! Well, either way if you aren’t totally won over by deadpan girl vocals explaining that they don’t wanna go back to work, or that they are gonna spit on the pope, then you operate on totally different terms to me, in a separate reality… The songs Gwilym, the make vocalist, sings have a blood-thirsty DESPERATE BICYCLES-goes-anarcho manner of delivery that is quite compelling. These are simple melancholic masterworks, sort of like THE SHAGGS playing FEELIES songs, or simple rock ’n’ roll like “Roadrunner”—not bar rocker nightmare chug, but true sounds made by bedroom punkers and disseminated with a vision and soul. Really idyllic for people who live in foggy seaside towns and want to listen to sounds that capture that melancholy feeling while retaining their punk rock anger… US/Canada punkers can get this from Revolver, as Nominal is based in Europe now.

Maximumrocknroll.com’s Record of the Week is back! Here’s one that’s on everyone’s top ten this month, reviewed by shitworker extraordinaire Dan Goetz. This review along with a zillion more can found in this month’s MRR!

AMDI PETERSENS ARMÉ put out the first and third best EPs of the early 2000s hardcore wave, which I think is up there with early ’80s hardcore as one of the best waves. Now that everyone who went gaga over them at the time is too grown up and listens to ICEAGE or whoever, I still blast both 7”s all the time and the APA symbol adorns my ankle in stick-and-poke form. Nostalgia is bittersweet, because I look at the photos and flyers in the booklet that came with this LP and realize that it’s been years since there have been bands/shows of this caliber on a regular basis. But I’m glad that the ephemera has been preserved, and despite the fact that their second EP is still available (both from Havoc and in dollar bins), this band is more than discography worthy. For anyone unfamiliar, AMDI PETERSENS ARMÉ played early-’80s-style hardcore that got many comparisons to early MINOR THREAT, though they were always a bit more complex than that, and certainly transcended the harDCore comparisons by the time of their second EP.
The first EP (on side A of this LP) is stripped down hardcore that has the perfect solid state guitar tone, precise, closed hi-hat drumbeat, and simple but catchy riffs, with a feeling that’s fierce, fun, cathartic, and youthful all at the same time, and to this day makes me want nothing more than to live in a punk house, give myself a stupid haircut, and skate all day for the rest of my life. But the second EP, Blod Ser Mere Virkeligt Ud På Film (on side B of this LP), is the real masterpiece, and is fit for stage-diving, listening closely and taking in its intricacies, contemplating the shittyness of life, or some combination thereof. If we must stick with comparisons, I’d say the playing and feeling evoke the darker FAITH songs (specifically the second half of the VOID split), some combination of S.O.A. and MINOR THREAT (mostly in the vocals), CIRCLE JERKS, and maybe the BAGS, for starters. But it has a sound that’s all its own, and while the first EP has a more fun sound, Blod has a bleakness that is well articulated by the various twists and turns the songs take, adding to their power and aggression, and yet many of the riffs are downright toe-tappers. “Hardcore Del II” is one of the most perfect punk instrumentals ever, and has enough swing and swagger that it could play over the opening scene of a teen insurrection film.

I can’t say a lot more that would do these songs justice, so if you haven’t heard them, get on it. This discography complies both EPs plus comp tracks, their demo, and some unreleased songs (that they were smart to leave off their records, as they’re more-or-less duds). For those of us who already know both records by heart, this discography includes a great booklet, chock full of photos and flyers in chronological order (including what looks like the majority of the flyers from their US tour in 2002), as well as an intro from DX and a back cover piece from Dave Hyde, who drove them on their US tour and recollects various tour stories. Needless to say, this band is a modern classic. People with taste haven’t forgotten, and people who know what’s up will be seeking out these songs for years to come.

FERTIL MISERIA – Cadenas EP (Discos Fuentes, 1994)
Last month a few of us watched a cool documentary at the compound about the early hardcore/punk scene in Medellin, Colombia, called Mas alla del No Fu­turo. It featured a series of interviews with old punks who had survived the rampant violence throughout the ’80s and ’90s in Colombia, and paints a vivid picture of how so many Medellin punks used hardcore as an avenue to escape the violence burning through the city at the time. Medellin was the center of Pablo Escobar’s infamous drug cartel, and many folks fell into the lure of killing for money or other dangerous work in the drug war. Many of the punks on this documentary testified that punk was their life and they spent all of their time making bands and having “punk parties.”  Otherwise they would more than likely have been sucked into the violence on the streets. Punks also (much like everywhere else) were targeted by police, and more than 3,000 of the youth were killed during these years. So the punks in this documentary are true survivors.
A shaved-headed Viki Castro, one of the very few women interviewed in the film, really grabbed our attention. Her testimony to those years was positive, strong, coherent, and confident, as was her presence on the screen. And then comes footage of her fronting a band! Enter FERTIL MISERIA, a four-piece — 3 women and a male drummer — seriously fucking shit up at a house show! Then they flash some record cover art that seriously blows our minds! So with thousands of punk records from all over the world at our fingertips, I rushed to the MRR shelves and pulled out this ripper (along with 7”s by I.R.A., B.S.N., IMAGEN, RASIX, the La Ciudad Podrida comp…) and became instantly obsessed! Look at that fucking cover! The Spanish lyrics promote peace and are smart and thoughtful. The music is raw hardcore punk, comprised of equal parts aggression and bounciness. Perfect blend, in my book.
It appears that FERTIL MISERIA is still active, and even did some dates in Europe this year. There is plenty of fun stuff to discover about this band on the web and a couple other releases to track down as well. So what are you waiting for?!

Our Record of the Week this time is actually a tape/download available from the band’s website at abergaz.bandcamp.com.
Man, this tape is a huge breath of fresh air, after reviewing so many predictable, stock, privileged bands — many of which are good, but simply lack the honesty, wit, intelligence, and passion that ABERGAZ demonstrates with this tape. On a first blind listen, the music is slickly recorded melodic hardcore punk with dramatically howled vocals and some weird parts. The closest comparison I can make would be Slovakian hardcore punk veterans DAVOVA PSYCHOZA — but I think many people looking for something familiar would struggle relating to this. (Am I being unfair to and judgmental about you, punks?) Anyways, ABERGAZ is from Zagreb, Croatia, and they are very expressive about what it means to be different (i.e., a punk) in a part of the world that has been divided into different countries by war, causing folks to be born with hostile mentalities toward neighboring regions. The four-panel fold-out tape insert translates and explains in English the meanings of all 17 of their songs. I keep trying to choose some of the great topics they sing about to give you an idea, but it’s so hard to pick just a few, and I just can’t type ’em all here, so I really urge you to track this down and fucking get into it and connect with it. Don’t just download it, fucking write them and connect with them and get the whole package the way it was meant to be, and interact with it. Support genuine punks who put three years of effort and all of their energy and money into releasing this. This is the kind of shit that gets me pumped about reviewing new, unknown punk music. Or hell, just pumped to engage in an international punk network where we can share our stories and ideas, support, relate to, and learn from each other. Okay, I think I’ve made myself clear here — ­ put away your INFERNÖH or HOAX record for a minute and spend a little time on ABERGAZ.

Peruvian punk documentaries: El Grito Subterráneo y Lima Explota


Published  September 25, 2012 By MRR

Our new bilingual web correspondent Mariel Acosta brings us a breakdown of two Peruvian punk documentaries—in English and Spanish, por supuesto—to coincide with our articles on the history of the Peruvian underground scene. El Grito Subterráneo and Lima Explota can be seen as a chronology of social and political events in Peru as the context and historical framework that has shaped Peruvian punks’ ideals and their scene…
El Grito Subterráneo (The Underground Scream) (1987)
Director: Julio Montero
A DIY low budget documentary that juxtaposes the Peruvian punk underground scene and lifestyle with presidential speeches and mainstream news segments, giving a historical, socioeconomic and political context to Lima’s ’80s punk scene. The film describes the country’s social situation through interviews and mainstream news reports providing an interesting contrast. El Grito Subterráneo shows the birth and development of an unconventional music circuit in an alarming social and historical context. The documentary came out originally on VHS and in more recent years on DVD; however, it’s hard to get a copy of it outside of Peru. Currently it is available online, though it’s split into several parts:

El Grito Subterráneo documents the “second wave” of Peruvian underground punk, which emerged with scarce resources, but a lot of enthusiasm, imagination and comradeship. This era started in the 1980s and persisted until the first years of the 1990s. The film features footage 19 of Peruvian bands — extinct bands and others that are still thriving in the scene, including Voz Propia, Leusemia, Eutanasia, Kaos, Flema, Narcosis, María Teta, Empujón Brutal, Sinkura, Guerrilla Urbana, Autopsia, Juventud La Caigua S.A., Zcuela Crrada, TBC, Daniel F, Erupto Maldonado, G-3, Psicosis, Sociedad de Mierda, Luxuria and Excomulgados.
The documentary’s intro begins with a manifesto of its mission, the political and cultural position of the punk youth at the time and their feelings towards Peruvian society’s status quo then:
01:37 “This video documents the youth’s artistic work that’s a testimony of its creative potential and libertarian character; it’s an example for the present and future generations. It’s a cultural production made by a group collective based on group work, consciousness and the will to change Peru’s society invoking the utopia of a fair and more humane system and new forms of living. We establish that the mass media diffuses values inadequate for the development of autonomous cultural forms because they’re at the service of multinationals. We establish that college education diverts from the immediate reality and that the civil society remains passive in the face of the deterioration of human rights”
02:56 “Rock is the legitimate expression of youth. Youth protest movements are presented by the system and the media. Stripped from its anti-establishment character, the 70s punk movement, the chaos generation, is the scream that recuperates its generational protesting charge. Expressive language, manifestation that assumes the underground vanguard that’s committed to the radical proposals for the renovation of our third-world Latin American reality.”
03:52 “By expressing myself through this video, I wish to develop a contemporary artistic discipline that breaks the hegemony of corporate TV stations and that’s capable of producing libertarian messages.”
Maria Teta
Among the most important segments of Grito Subterraneo, in videos 2 and 3, are images of a mainstream news report showing an underground where youth with “an anarchic posture and foul language express their rejection to the society we live in,” as described by the reporter. Furthermore, the correspondent interviews some of the kids and asks questions regarding their way of dancing, the music they’re listening to and their politics, and further into their interview other kids give their opinion on the posers that attend the shows, who “say they are punks, but they are shit!”
In the same news report they interview a psychologist and a psychiatrist who give their interpretations, which don’t differ from each other or from reality, on the behavior they observe in the punks — their rejection to society and their desire to change it by seeking to destroy superficial socioeconomic values. At the same time, the news reports are alternated with footage of Guerilla Urbana playing at that show, and in the background one can hear their songs “Vivo en una ciudad muerta” (“I Live in a Dead City”) and “Eres una pose” (“You’re a Poser”). [You can read the obituary for Guerilla Urbana guitarist Jose Eduardo Matute here.]
In video number 5 the first band is interviewed. They propose that the bands that represent the movement should be more militant — that is, they should not only sing their stances and politics, but they should also take action in order to sustain the movement. They also suggest that kids shouldn’t get into punk as a fad, but that punks should maintain their ideals and manifest their concerns.
In video number 7, the members of Eutanasia (see the article on Eutanasia’s reunion, in the June 2012 issue of MRR) are interviewed and they give accounts on problems within the scene, such as, sectarianism, divisions and their repercussions. These guys advocate for unity among the groups. Eutanasia also mentions that they sing social commentary songs and through these they manifest their discontent and nonconformity towards the society and political climate of Lima in the ’80s, and through them they express their lives and experiences. The following band, Leusemia, criticizes the state of the punk movement, stating that what was once underground rock was now dead. They also mention the danger of the commercialization of artistic expressions of punk, and the difficulties bands go through to play shows in some venues, given the dominant society’s rejection of their expressions, which leads them to create an underground circuit.
The following videos (8 and 9), give a more political twist to the documentary; towards the end of video 8 there’s a speech by president Alan Garcia (in office from 1985-1990) from the parliament. There he addresses the nation during a (unspecified) national holiday. Then on video 9, there’s a sequence of bulletins and news on La Matanza de los Penales, The Prison Massacres in the San Juan de Lurigancho, El Frontón y Santa Bárbara prisons where hundreds of inmates in all tree rioted simultaneously to demand the release of political prisoners who were accused of terrorism.
On video 11, María Teta y El Empujón Brutal give an awesome performance at a show, with provocative songs that allude to feminism and subversion to religion by mocking some religious practices defying conventional values. In the interview of María Teta that follows, she speaks about police repression and how she was once was tortured for hours when she was arrested. The documentary concludes with a Sinkura interview and more footage of DIY underground shows.
Lima Explota (Lima Explodes) (2005)
Director: Santiago Herrera
This documentary presents Peru’s hardcore punk scene of the 1990s. Lima Explota is a commitment to everyone who left their mark in the development of this genre. Hardcore punk clearly expresses that it’s not just a phase in Lima’s music scene but it’s also the result of hard work from the bands that throughout history have consolidated this movement, and through this, establishing that hardcore is a firm and truthful form of expression; a social critique, and a way to deal with life.

Lima Explota features interviews and archival footage of shows from bands like Desarme, Futuro Incierto, Alhambre, Asmereir, Generacion Perdida, Metamorfosis, Dios Hastio and Contracorriente. In the interviews, bands comment on the bad influence mainstream media, MTV, and mainstream “punk” bands, like Blink 182 had on people’s perception of punk and the influence of this in the scene. Also, they address issues like the danger of the commercialization of punk, which led to the disintegration of some bands and subsequently of the hardcore scene by the mid- to late 90s.
A continuación, sinopsis y enlaces de una serie de documentales que retratan la escena punk subterránea de Perú desde los años ochenta y los noventa. Los documentales también pueden ser considerados como una cronología de eventos sociales y políticos que marcaron a la sociedad peruana en esas décadas así como el marco histórico y el contexto que de alguna manera ayudo a formar los ideales de los punks y su escena.
El Grito Subterráneo (1987)
Director: Julio Montero
Documental de bajo presupuesto y autogestionado esta formado por una yuxtaposición de imágenes y escenas de actividades de la vida y la escena subterránea de los punks peruanos de los ochenta — ya sean conciertos, actividades de arte, entrevistas a bandas — discursos políticos y segmentos de noticias los cuales aportan el contexto histórico, socioeconómico y político de la época. Este trabajo es un conjunto de imágenes se mezclan con un registro de la situación social de la época, generando un contrapunto muy interesante. El documental retrata el nacimiento y desarrollo de un circuito de música no convencional en un contexto histórico social alarmante. El documental fue distribuido originalmente en formato VHS y en formato DVD en años recientes, pero es muy difícil conseguir una copia fuera de Perú. Actualmente se puede ver completo en Internet, aunque dividido en varias partes.

El Grito Subterráneo es un registro de los primeros días del resurgimiento del punk “subte” peruano. El nacimiento de la “Segunda Ola” de este movimiento que se hizo con muchas ganas, con pocos recursos, imaginación y compañerismo. Un movimiento que comenzó en los 80 y no paró hasta los primeros años de la década del 90. En el video podemos ver a bandas ya extintas y otras que aun perseveran y siguen presentándose en los escenarios. Las bandas presentadas en el documental son Voz Propia, Leusemia, Eutanasia, Kaos, Flema, Narcosis, María Teta, Empujón Brutal, Sinkura, Guerrilla Urbana, Autopsia, Juventud La Caigua S.A., Zcuela Crrada, TBC, Daniel F, Erupto Maldonado, G-3, Psicosis, Sociedad de Mierda, Luxuria y Excomulgados.

La primera parte del documental inicia con un manifiesto de su misión, con la posición política y cultural de la juventud punk en ese entonces y sus sentimientos hacia la sociedad peruana y el estatus quo:
01:37 “Este video es documento de la labor artística juvenil testimonio de las posibilidades creativas y su carácter libertario. Ejemplo para las presentes y futuras generaciones. Producción cultural gestada por un grupo en base al trabajo colectivo, a la conciencia y voluntad de cambio de la sociedad peruana plasmando un grito por la utopia de un sistema más justo, más humano y nuevas formas de vida. Constatamos que los medios masivos de comunicación difunden valores inadecuados al desarrollo de formas culturales propias estando al servicio de las transnacionales. Constatamos la educación universitaria alejada de la realidad inmediata así como la pasividad de la sociedad civil frente al deterioro de los derechos humanos.”
02:56 “El rock, expresión legitima de los jóvenes y los movimientos de protesta juvenil devienen en ser presentados por el sistema y los MMCC [medios de comunicación]. Despojado de su carácter contestatario, la corriente punk de los 70s, generación del caos, es el grito que recupera su carga de protesta generacional. Lenguajes expresivos, manifestación que asume la vanguardia subterránea comprometida con propuestas radicales de renovación en nuestra realidad tercermundista y latinoamericana.”
03:52 “Al expresarme en video deseo desarrollar una disciplina artística contemporánea que rompa con la hegemonía de las grandes televisoras y que sea capaz de producir mensajes libertarios”.
Entre los segmentos más destacados de Grito Subterráneo, en los videos 2 y 3, se presentan imágenes de un programa de noticias, o de desinformación, en el que presentan imágenes de un concierto subterráneo en donde los jóvenes con clara “postura anárquica y lenguaje soez expresaron su rechazo a la sociedad en que vivimos.”
Más adelante, la reportera que se encuentra en el concierto entrevista a algunos de los asistentes y hace algunas preguntas como porque bailan de esa manera, sobre la música que escuchan, su política y otros jóvenes dan sus opiniones acerca las pose que “dicen ser punks y son un carajo!”
En el segmento también entrevistan a un siquiatra y a una sicóloga, quienes dan interpretaciones no muy disímiles uno del otro y de la realidad acerca del comportamiento que observan entre los punks— su rechazo a la sociedad de ese entonces y su deseo de cambiarla al buscar destruir valores socioeconómicos superficiales.
En todo esto, a través de imágenes alternadas con las entrevistas y como música de fondo se escucha la banda Guerrilla Urbana con sus canciones “Vivo en una ciudad muerta” y “Eres una pose”.
En el video 5, esta la primera banda entrevistada, la cual propone que haya más militancia por parte de las bandas que representan el movimiento, en que no solo canten sus posturas y sus ideologías, sino que también actúen para así mantener el movimiento en pie. Que no sea por moda ni algo pasajero, sino que las ideas se mantengan y se manifiesten las inquietudes de los jóvenes.
En el video 7, los integrantes de Eutanasia (Ver artículo del retorno de Eutanasia en la edición impresa de MRR Junio 2012), son entrevistados y hablan sobre los problemas de la escena, sectarismo y separación y sus repercusiones. Estos abogan por la unión de los grupos. Eutanasia, también, menciona que el contenido de sus letras contiene críticas sociales y a través de estas manifiestan su descontento e inconformidad hacia la sociedad y el clima político en la Lima de los 80, y expresan sus vivencias y experiencias. Más adelante, los integrantes de Leusemia, critican el estado de la movida punk en ese tiempo, al decir que lo que se conocía como rock subterráneo para ese entonces ya había muerto. También mencionan el peligro de la comercialización de las expresiones artísticas del punk y las dificultades que las bandas enfrentan para realizar conciertos en una sociedad donde sus expresiones son mal vistas que los lleva a la creación del circuito subterráneo.
Los videos siguientes (8 y 9) le dan un giro hacia la política al documental, hacia el final del 8 se puede ver un discurso del presidente Alan García (presidente de1985 a 1990) desde el parlamento, en donde se dirige al país durante unas fiestas patrias.
Luego en el 9, presentan boletines y noticias sobre La Matanza de los Penales en junio de 1986, en las prisiones San Juan de Lurigancho, El Frontón y Santa Bárbara, en donde intervinieron militares luego de que cientos de presos se amotinaran simultáneamente en las 3 para reclamar la liberación de presas políticos acusadas de terrorismo.
En el video 11, María Teta y El Empujón Brutal dan una presentación excelente en el escenario, con letras provocativas que aluden al feminismo y a la subversión hacia
la religión con una puesta que ridiculiza a rituales religiosos desafiando los valores convencionales. Luego en la entrevista que le sigue ella habla sobre la represión policial y explica como fue torturada por horas una vez que estuvo presa.
Con el próximo video, el documental concluye con entrevistas a Sinkura y con imágenes de conciertos subterráneos autogestionados.

Lima Explota (2005)
Director: Santiago Herrera
Documental de bandas hardcore que abarca el periodo 1990 hasta finales de los 90. Lima Explota es un compromiso con toda la gente que marcó una huella dentro de este género; a su vez, este género expresa claramente que no solo es una fase en la escena musical limeña si no es también un trabajo en el cual las bandas a través de la historia han consolidado este movimiento, dejando dicho que el hardcore es una forma de expresión firme y verdadera, una crítica social y una manera de afrontar la vida moderna.

Lima Explota esta compuesto por entrevistas y material de archivo de bandas como Desarme, Futuro Incierto, Alhambre, Asmereir, Generación Perdida, Metamorfosis, Dios Hastío y Contracorriente. En las entrevistas, algunas bandas hacen comentarios sobre la mala influencia de los medios de comunicación y canales como MTV y de bandas comerciales como Blink 182 los cuales influenciaron la percepción de las personas sobre la movida punk. Además, tratan el tema del peligro de la comercialización de punk, y su relevamiento para dar paso a otros géneros en los 90 (como la música alternativa), lo cual llevo a la desintegración de algunas bandas y consecuentemente de la escena hardcore entre mediados y finales de los 90.

Let me start by saying that these boys have been busy busy busy, with their kicking-and-punching first tape, aptly named Keep It Short and Simple – K.I.S.S., in 2009, then another killer tape in 2010, which I also friggin’ loved, so I have anticipated this for quite a while! I can tell that they’ve definitely worked on this LP, and these tracks are doused in indignation, antisocial aggression and contempt for humanity. I can relate: “I don’t give a shit about what you did, when you were my age in 1986 … Sometimes I wish I were deaf, I would have peace at last.” Yes, antisocial hardcore for angry people, reminiscent of USHC classics like the CIRCLE JERKS, DEAD KENNEDYS, MINOR THREAT and more contemporary outfits such as the REGULATIONS and BRUTAL KNIGHTS. The compositions are still tight and catchy but the band has developed them more, with slower, groovier hooks, slower intros, meaner guitar interludes and solos, layers, and the ever-present spiteful vocals; the kind of spite discovered in late adulthood, when you realize adulthood sucks and your peers are a joke!
While SNOB VALUE‘s work has never lacked lyrical aggression or sonic force, these tracks have a more polished production, which makes conventional sense for a debut LP I suppose, though they don’t entirely lack that seedy, subversive sound. Also, the artwork is quite minimal (“contrast reduction, disappeared horizon”) and while it’s handmade and still looks good, it doesn’t compare to their previous punk-ass designs. “1986,” “Hammer & Öl,” and “Whiteout” are the standout tracks. “1986” is dark, honest, ballsy and foaming at the mouth — their pièce de résistance for this album, if you ask me; “Hammer & Öl” is sung in the band’s native German and, of course, sounds all the more menacing for it; and the title track is a SNOB VALUE essential: short and simple, fast, effective, mind-pounding. I’m already flipping this faster than I can keep track of. While I do appreciate the more serious take they seem to have taken on this release, I honestly hope they keep some distortion and dirt intact. It’s that blunt frustration that makes ’em so great! Minor detail: I love it when bands have little messages scratched onto the wax; on ether side of this white 12″ was: “World peace can be fun—Anarchy’s a blast.” Fuck yes!

Here’s a double demo review from this months MRR, by Robert Collins and Matt Badenhop respectively. This 7-song ANTIMOB tape may be impossible to find by now (maybe not though!), but it’s more of a preview of the band’s upcoming LP anyway, so keep your eyes peeled for that in the near future!

Second demo from this Greek powerhouse, ANTIMOB blow the Eurocrust paradigm out of the water. Definitely rooted in modern melodic heavy hardcore/crust, but with healthy nods towards raised Japanese fists, this is a short teaser before their forthcoming full length. Raging from start to finish, this is nothing short of pure excellence—if they were from Japan or the States, the band’s name would be on the tip of everyone’s tongue. Mandatory.
— Robert Collins
This is an absolutely crushing effort by this long running Greek hardcore band. The songs on this tape seem to flow as some kind of continuous hardcore journey or something—it just keeps moving, never letting up. No copycatting, gimmicks, trend following or tribute bullshit on this tape. Just pure, honest, passionate hardcore punk with galloping drums, tense/memorable riffs, a gritty and convincing vocal attack and an underlying darkness lurking throughout every song. There is nothing pretentious or superficial here. If you are looking for some generic D-beat, noise-not-music “raw” punk, goth/darkwave throwback, INFEST worship, bands singing in languages they don’t know just ’cause their favorite bands sing in it, “anarcho” bands who aren’t anarchists, or any of the other stale, overdone sub-genres of punk, look elsewhere. As I understand it, this is a demo recording of their upcoming LP. Judging by the sound of this tape, I predict that the ANTIMOB LP will be the best hardcore record of 2012. I’m so fucking tired of trendy sounds and images. Give me more ANTIMOB! Yamas, boys!

DROWNING ROSES ‎– Aus Forschung Und Technik 7″ (self released, 1987)
DROWNING ROSES formed in Minden/Westfalen, Germany, out of the ashes of HUMAN DECAY, PHALLIC SYMBOLS, and NEUROTIC ARSEHOLES, sounding most akin to the last of the three. After releasing a demo they released this great 7″ in 1987. I was initially drawn to this EP because of the NEUROTIC ARSEHOLES relation and the cover’s strange purple/orange color scheme and art that left the sounds to be unpredictable.
The title track, “Aus Forschung und Technik” (“From Research and Technology”) kicks off with four nice open chords and then bursts out with a catchy “snake-charmy” type guitar melody (I’m a sucker for these riffs) and a rapid dual vocal attack, straddling the line between hardcore and classic Deutschpunk. “10 Years” follows a similar blueprint but has even catchier guitar melodies and is sung in English — a song observing the state of punk ten years after its supposed inception. Check the last two lines of each verse for a basic idea:
While many Punks got teenage depressions, failed the connection or followed the fashion…Times have changed but the authority conditions are still the same – still the same!
Side B slows it down with “Kein Thema für Heut,” a moody, epic number that greatly delivers in melodic hooks where it lacks in speed. Some may find the dual guitar melodies too metal, but I don’t think so — just great fucking songwriting with tons of feeling!
DROWNING ROSES also released a split 7″ with NOFX and two LPs, none of which really grabbed me the way this 7″ does. According to their MySpace page they have done random gigs up until 2008, so they may still be getting together from time to time.

The difference in attitudes regarding age in punk and jazz is split in much the same way as the age is regarded in Western and Eastern action movies. In Western action movies, youth is usually privileged as a source of strength and power, whereas in Eastern action movies, and martial arts films in particular, the older a character is, the more they are represented as a dangerous and skilled fighter. Enter APOGEE SOUND CLUB, featuring San Francisco underground music veterans Liz Byrne (bass, the KIRBY GRIPS, others) and Wade Driver (guitar, the HICKOIDS, 50 MILLION and about 50 million other bands), as well as the younger Harrison Holloway on drums (the MOLESTATIONS). Liz and Wade have been honing their craft for a long time now and in a number of different styles, including different kinds of rock music, pop, experimental projects and jazz. And unlike many, or the stereotypical Western action movie character, they have retained a high level of artistic craftsmanship, originality and ferocious power. Many in the Bay Area took umbrage with the REACTION (Liz and Wade’s previous concern), but to deny that they were a visceral rock ‘n’ roll assault would be, I believe, folly. APOGEE SOUND CLUB represents a distinct new direction for the pair. Gone are the mod allusions and the direct rock riffs and guitar leads. Instead, ASC pushes with a choppier and much more angular guitar style, that accommodates much more for play in the playing, but whilst still sounding tight as a bull’s ass. The rolling, groovy bass is still there, in much the same way as it was in the REACTION, but it has been effectively reshaped so as not to draw comparisons to the previous outing. This style rounds out the sound of the band and this record, which is crucial when you consider the drumming. Harrison is spastic, fast and would at times draw the comment “over-busy” from me if it didn’t work as well as it did. Here, four songs are given the vinyl treatment with a nice, slightly lo-fi sounding recording. The three with vocals all draw on all of the aforementioned qualities to craft killer punk songs. The lyrics are especially worth noting, as they draw on Wade’s considerable knowledge of subversive philosophy and politics, especially Situationism. However, the crowning moment of this record is the instrumental “You Fill Me With Inertia.” This may be one of my favorite new songs of the year. The simple driving guitars, the underpinning bass, the clattering drums, all surging to the one moment when the guitar stands alone with one ringing, slightly dissonant chord… a singular moment and a proper beginning for an exciting new band.

This is a hard hitter. Cool Greek zine featuring interviews with D-takt and Rapunk Records, Amebix, Pyroklast, Deathhammer, Stripmines, a tribute to Void, movie reviews of my second favorite genre: action, featuring one of my favorite action movies, John Woo’s Hardboiled, a photo spread, very well done reviews and a small section of ads in the back. There is also a guest column by our very own newbie coordinator and, no, that is not the (only) reason this is a good zine… No Exit is being created among crumbling antiquated and fatally flawed infrastructure; in a dangerous climate of power grabbing which has created turmoil and dangerous situations with real human consequences. One could argue that strife creates fertile ground for creativity, but that’s easy to say when you are sitting in an easy chair watching “strife” on the news. What I will say is that there is no level of desperation or overwhelming level of nihilism that a weaker set (norms) might succumb to in a similar situation that would snuff out the creativity or love of punk here. The level of crazy shit going on in Greece is real, but rather than an overt expression, this zine is infused by and informed by it, in the interview style to the humor to the reviews. Great zine, good read and a reminder that nothing can keep the punks down.

With a band I’ve seen live so many times that I can repeat their lyrics in my sleep and raise my fist in tune subconsciously, it can be hard to adjust to new material. I usually prefer the old stuff that is like an etching in my brain. I love BRAIN KILLER‘s older demo songs like “Fight Back” and “The Breaking Wheel” — they’re carved into me and trigger memories of some of the best shows that I have ever attended. Songs like those cause one to burn with an inner fury that can be brought to the surface with haste only by the gut wrenching deliverance from a band with as much potency as BRAIN KILLER. From their demo to this EP, there is still that true hardcore fury that hasn’t faded over the years — they’ve kept their fire burning.
BRAIN KILLER has the rage and intensity of FRAMTID with the blatant foundation of growing up on the PARTISANS and CHAOS UK. I’m always amazed at the lyrics, with their structure and cutting use of language. The eloquence of the words delivered, the feeling of their execution creates total perfection and has been improved with the addition of Dan’s voice. Dan’s co-vocals compliment the original line-up well and give this band an interesting edge that not all bands in this genre have right now. BRAIN KILLER evolved with its members and their sound, and got better and more devastating. How many punk bands pull that off like a fine fucking wine?
The drums on this EP are still driving and violent and the bass and guitar are as punk as you need. Throughout the record, as on previous releases, the constant guitar feedback is scorching and done with skill. This isn’t messy noise — all sounds delivered by this band are done with an impact that is deliberate and inescapable. This release, and I think it could be partially due to the dual vocals, has a very Burning Britain feel. It captures the anger and frustrations of modern times just as well as anarcho bands like CONFLICT or CRUCIFIX did in the ’80s. Every track on this record is a scorcher. You’ll have to pull the plug or tag my toe to get this off my turntable. It is the most perfect final release for a band that had a good run — although there may be a flexi in the works? Thank you to these Boston punx for this record and R.I.P. Nick Poot.

We’ll take a short break from all of the MRR history and dive into some cool shit happening in the here-and-now. This review of issue #3 of Richmond, VA, fanzine Excitement Level Zero written by Bob Goldie appears in Maximum Rocknroll #351. You can order Excitement Level Zero #3 from Grave Mistake Records — and you can also check out ELZ #2 on the Sorry State site…

After getting really cynical about the dejected state of affairs in the current punk scene, I was mercifully relieved to come across this boss issue of Excitement Level Zero. In the spirit of the old days, before Hot Topic-style, computer generated, self congratulatory punk magazines done in the name of obtaining free records (or fucking CDs), this Virginia-based hardcore rag comes across as a work of authentic conviction done in true DIY cut-and-paste style and genuine fuck-you attitude. So what’s inside? After a classic full-page photo of CRIPPLED YOUTH there is an interview with a Canadian hardcore band called WORD ON THE STREET, whom I had never heard of, but totally want to check out now. Another feature that I totally appreciated was an attempt to list and assess all of the INFEST bootlegs that have ever appeared. And these bootleg reviews, like the other record reviews found throughout, are honest and to the point. Next is an interview with the awesome band MAD WORLD, followed by a road trip journal about heading up to New York to check out BOSTON STRANGLER and some other bands. The whole issue is pretty basic and can be read in ten minutes, but it’s got the spirit and is one of the best things I’ve come across in a few months.

Their first record was really good, but on this release CROSS STITCHED EYES have set the bar into the stratosphere for the legions of punks diving into the world of modern hardcore punk. As steeped in KILLING JOKE and BAUHAUS as the sharp angular attack of early anarcho punk, tracks like “Animation” jerk to and fro with an uncomfortably drunken swagger, while “Suffocation” and “Existence” are undeniable plodding death rock masterpieces. There are still a few songs that bring to mind the RUDIMENTARY PENI comparisons that accompanied their debut, but the highlights of Decomposition are in their ability to make old sounds seem new again—all of the sensibilities of a brilliant ’80s death rock record crammed into a modern DIY box that even the most narrow-minded punks can get behind. A fukkn great record.

In commemoration of our newest MRR Photo Issue, our Zine of the Month is a photo zine from noted zinester/illustrator/photographer Stéphane Delevacque. This review, by Julia Booze, appears in the latest issue as well — buy it now!
The package I opened came with three thick photo zines and a one-page foldout! Not sure if that is what you get for the listed price — maybe that cover price is just for the main anniversary issue, celebrating 20 years of Rad Party… holy shit! So amazing to me that anything can last that long. All of these zines are very professional feeling, maybe because they are printed and the paper quality is above average, either way they have absolutely beautiful photos. There is a hefty catalogue breaking down of all past issues, showing the cover and telling what each issue was about. It came out as part of a zine exhibit highlighting noteworthy long-running zines. Since I can only sort of glean a little meaning here and there, I am guessing about what it all says. I don’t think you need to read French to enjoy Rad Party #42, which contains a lot of nice band portraits, some familiar faces and a show review to accompany each photo. I bet this zine is considered a national treasure. If you are curious but afraid to spend the money, there is a blog that shows some of the awesome photos. I tooled around on it for a while enjoying my feeble attempts to read it all.

Two for the price of one this week with MRR reviewers Kenny Kaos and Brace Belden!

BIG EYES – “Back From the Moon/I Don’t Care About Friday Night” 45
Wow. This is badass. Seriously.
The really good ones are often the toughest to review. It’s mid-tempo, it’s melodic and catchy, it’s got a really full sound and the female vocals carry a sense of urgency that makes the difference. I suppose if I had to label it, I’d call it power-pop, but I refuse to label it. This one is going to live on my turntable for a little while.
Awesome. Find it.
(Grave Mistake)
—Kenny Kaos

HOT NASTIES – The Invasion of the Tribbles EP
Reissue of a Calgary punk single from 1980 and it’s great! It’s got that British sound a lot of Canadian groups had for some reason, and it’s a pretty perfect meld of pre-UK82 but post-77 Britpunk sound mixed with tasty (and tasteful) pop licks that symbolize everything I like about punk. Dumb teenagers from nowhere writing pop hits that maybe four hundred people will ever hear (especially with the original 7” running at around $300).
The B-side has a bit of a Flying Nun sound, almost. If you’re a modern punk, by which I mean if you’re a genius who likes all kinds of good music, and you don’t (or maybe only slightly) ghettoize yourself in some bizarre, childish fetishistic sub-sect of a youth movement that was at one point led by someone named Johnny Rotten and died when people were still wearing bell bottoms, you’ll recognize a pretty wide range of sounds going on here. Which means it’s a great goddamn record — and hell, who knows, even skinheads might like it. Ugly Pop is doing a small series of Canadian punk reissues. Off to a great start with this one.

DOWN SYNDROME – self titled EP (Black Sun Records, 1984)
We are not called DOWN SYNDROME because of a man named Down who founded the genetic disorder, if that were the case, we would be called DOWN’S SYNDROME. Rather, the meaning of our name is derived from the direct definitions of the words in reference to humanity’s condition.
“DOWN – to lower or worsen condition”
“SYNDROME – a group of signs and symptoms that occur together and characterize a particular abnormality.”
This, along with lyrics, itemized pressing info and costs for the record, and a peaceful/insightful anecdote by each band member is printed on the inner sleeve of this Edmonton-based hardcore punk band’s only vinyl output. Although Canadian, DOWN SYNDROME fits right in with the sound of many Euro hardcore bands of the era, combining melody, punchy drums, and anarcho-inspired lyrics. The mid-tempo tracks on this EP are great, but the faster songs really showcase the band’s power. “Values” is an eternal mix tape-worthy scorcher! One of my faves – super underrated.
Here’s a link to a short interview.
DOWN SYNDROME – “Other Ways”
DOWN SYNDROME – “Solitary Confinement”
DOWN SYNDROME – “Racism”
DOWN SYNDROME – “Pain and Hunger”

Well, punks, here you have it! A kick-fucking-ass EP! I have been laying in wait for something new by these Georgia punks, as I have been into this band since I first heard their Blot Out the Worthless Sun LP and saw them live. These songs are fast and brutal with some truly sick growled mean vokills—the lyrics are not cheery…weird, huh? I guess if I had to break this down to its simplest description, this is dark, fast, crusty, punk with nods to psych rock, black metal and some truly fucked up version of bleak Southern sounds. Their style combines often badly-done genres touched on in punk, yet NÜ-KLĒ-ƏR BLAST SUNTAN rolls them into some truly creative and exciting tracks. The guitar work is fucked up and weird, like this guy learned how to play guitar listening to HAWKWIND on the wrong speed (yeah, everyone has said that about this band, but listen to this for reals!), with a warped record on a turntable belt that was a about to give out. There is order to the song composition here, but not one that punks are used to and all the formulaic shit that keeps these tracks together is obliterated by the unpretentious creativity of this band. These songs will take you to sonic places you didn’t know you even liked. Fuck yeah. Love this. (SPHC)

Γκούλαγκ (Gulag) – In the Showyard (Στην Αυλή Των Θεαμάτων) LP
(Lazy Dog Records, 1990)
In the honor of our new Athenian coordinator Lydia, and my upcoming trip to Greece, I chose to feature this criminally underrated Greek punk masterpiece. GULAG, from the northern Greek city of Thessaloniki, started playing in the mid ’80s. On this platter the band charms us with its distinctly crafted guitar and vocal-driven melodies, which really are unmatched by anything, in my opinion. In the Showyard is such a dynamic album – non-formulaic, with a wide range of tempos and moods. It’s melodic, sometimes aggressive, sometimes dark, sometimes eloquent, but never boring or predictable. There’s something for everyone here, seriously. Gulag is a truly unique sounding band.
GULAG – Εθισμός (Addiction)
 GULAG – Απολογία (Apology)
 GULAG – Κοινωνική Στοργή (Social Affection)
 GULAG – Χρώματα Θαμπά (Lustreless Colours)
 GULAG – Νομάδες (Nomads)
The songs are sung in Greek, but the insert of this LP includes English translations. The lyrics seem to be honest and thoughtful and even poetic at times. It makes me wonder how much meaning is lost through the translation.
I do not know much more about the band, but I do know they also released:
Είσοδος Κινδύνου 0° C LP (Lazy Dog Records, 1987)
Big Talk 7” (Wreck-age Records, 1989)
Η Άλλη Πλευρά/Άλλες 8 Χαμένες Ώρες 7” (Lazy Dog Records, 1994)
Πάτα Γερά LP (Lazy Dog Records, 1996)
While searching for more info on Greek punk I ran across Punk.gr and discovered a great video of them playing in Athens this past march, and it seems they still have their magic!

This is how you do it. Sometimes I think one of the hardest things to do in the context of the current punk scene is to be in a good hardcore band that stands the test of time. Not a generic replication of something that happened thirty years ago; that’s easy. I have so many records I had to buy that now when I flip through my 7”s I can’t even remember what the fucking band sounded like. Records that blend into one by bands that were probably fun to be in, whose friends remember the good times, but… five minutes pass and they are gone. When a band like OMEGAS comes along, who are playing a particular genre/style of HC, sure, but who can actually write songs; who bring to mind a certain era of NYHC, yes, but have their own take, their own personality. The vocals are unhinged, the riffs are classic but fucked up. Their LP ruled my turntable last year and I can’t stop listening to this 7” either. Savage, mutant yet straight-ahead, relentless destruction — no pose, just fucking HC for the HC. Get this and the recently reissued New Breed comp and join the cult. (Painkiller Records)

To start with, it should be noted that, this record rules. No, “rules” is an understatement. It destroys, it’s magic and it sets the world on fire. RVIVR is one of one best pop-punk bands of the decade. It’s hard to recommend a band more strongly. Lately it feels like they have been turning off a lot of people because they are so outspoken about their politics. Political and social consciousness plays a central role in their music, and their shows. Which is kind of a like a mosquito buzzing around the face for all the folks who are just there to dance and party ’cause the music is kind of feel-good party music, but the lyrics have substance. And when I say “outspoken” I mean “viciously outspoken.” But their messages are always totally right on, they honestly demand our attention. There are lots of records that come out every month that are good, but rarely is there one that’s important. This record is important. And it’s not that the songs are just really good, or just that the message is significant. It’s that they are both happening in unison while recreating everything you like about pop-punk into something new and exciting. Anyway, as the title implies, this is a compilation of all their earlier recordings. On this record they have compiled both sold out 7″s and a 12″ EP only released in Europe. This is the best place to start if you’re discovering the band for the first time, but will be nothing new to folks who have followed this band for the last few years—except for the cover of “Elizabethan Collar” which doesn’t appear anywhere else. Totally awesome, totally essential. (FS)

Our Record of the Week this time around is a cassette! Duluth, MN’s own Mike Wilson provided this guest review in the current issue of Maximum Rocknroll magazine…
This is an easy one. Get this tape!! Great comp of all Sacramento, CA, bands from 1999-2004. Lots of classic stuff here. Sacramento has produced a specific breed of punk/pop/garage bands over the past 25 years or so that all somehow have a similar feel. This 24-song tape is a great representation of the “Sacramento sound” that we all know and love. I would say that the BANANAS are the band of this category that is the most well known. They have a fantastic song on here, an earlier song of theirs called “Mr. Octopus Is Dead.” Not every band sounds the same though—two bands stand out as being particularly different (PETS and the GYNAS), but all the tracks flow together really nicely. My personal favorites of this tape include the BANANAS, THE FOUR EYES, MILHOUSE USA (I forgot how good that band was! [I know! —ed.]), ROCK THE LIGHT, and HORNY MORMONS. But there is definitely no filler here—every band is at least good, if not great. This tape is by no means a definitive all time Sacramento comp (see SEWER TROUT, NAR, POUNDED CLOWN, LIZARDS, LOS HEUVOS, etc.), but it is a great start to one. (Pleasant Screams Cassettes)

BREAD AND WATER – Future Memories EP (Burrito Records 2000)

Let me direct you to your local record store used bin for a cheap score! That’s right — you don’t have to spend big bucks to obtain a classic hardcore record.
In the late ’90s – early 00’s BREAD AND WATER was the beacon for the Dallas hardcore scene. Marked by never ending, incredible, melodic guitar riffs, Amie’s direct vocal attack and trademark stage swagger, and a basic, driving rhythm section, Bread and Water stood out among the legions of punk bands across the world. They played a chief role in organizing shows and events in the Dallas–Ft. Worth area and did several tours of North America. Bread and Water’s politics are spot on (heavy on the animal rights) and they were always playing benefit shows. I do remember them getting some due recognition at the time, so by posting this brilliant EP I’m hoping to make sure that they aren’t forgotten. Listen to that triumphant guitar riff on “Remember” and tell me it doesn’t get you pumped!
Listen to/download BREAD AND WATER’s Future Memories EP:
“Remember”
 “Cash for Houses”
 “No Compromise”
 “Death Sentence”
 “Fear of God”
 “Will Not Argue”
In addition to this EP, BREAD AND WATER also released these other great records:
Strength in Numbers EP – 1999 (self released)
split 7″ with Reason of Insanity – 2000 (Burrito Records)
split 7″ withRussian School of Ballet” – 2001 (Systemsuck Records)
s/t LP – 2003 (Burrito Records)
Everything So Far CD discography (self released)
They recorded their swansong “Void” for the compilation CD Women in Hardcore which accompanied the zine Short, Fast, & Loud #11 – and what a great note to end on before going their separate ways. Listen to “Void” here.

Oh dang! Classic Brazilian crossover-flavored HC, D-beat driven, lo-fi old schoolers ARMAGEDOM deliver two tracks recognizable in their buzzy metallic riffage, snare attack along with the throaty Portuguese yells. This is their same great sound with some good solid songs to appease the metalleros in the punk scene that like their shit raw and intense. On the flip side we are lucky to get two ragin’ tracks from the new Portland band TEROKAL. Their demo ruled and this is even better (especially because you can fucking hear everything). The drums are driving and solid with some flourishes of banged out fills. The bass thumps away at your melon, and in combination with the drums the rhythm section pulls you from the chest in their rapid fire. When the music does slow to mid-tempo you don’t get to catch your breath… the beats pound on your chest and the guitars are relentlessly driving. The two guitars are definitely distinct and full with the occasional well executed solos reminding me that POISON IDEA listened to the same shit this band listens to when they started up. The vocals are my favorite kind of higher pitched scream that is ugly and almost sounds like this dude is intensely complaining about something. Sung in Spanish with some total brutality and urgency. I am really into this dude’s style. This all comes together to sound very early Scandi and raw. If you like TÖTALITAR, you will be into this. The one thing that I could have done without is that the record plays from the outside in which may be problematic if you have an auto return on your player, but WTF… this is a damn good record. The fact that you have to handle it some, makes it that much more memorable. The cover is a limited edish, really nicely screen printed design with black silver and red paint. There is a copied insert with lyrics,  and there is a big ass poster of the cover! Yay! Check this out! (Odio Los Discos: odiolosdiscos@hotmail.com)

Alright, this week our From the Vaults feature is back with a vengeance! Today shitworker Matt Badenhop digs out a treasure from the Maximum record library for his debut blog on MRR.com. Take it  away, Matt!…

Compilations can be mixed bags — hot and cold — sometimes containing a few good songs accompanied by a bunch of throwaway tracks. Another pitfall for comps is when some or most of the songs are just pulled from bands’ releases. This can be helpful to draw you to seek out the bands’ material, but then maybe the compilation isn’t as special anymore. At least this is how I’ve felt about some punk comps in the past. With so much focus and fetishizing of punk and hardcore from places like Japan, Sweden, and Finland, I thought it would be fun to point out this unappreciated classic featuring some of Germany’s finest from 1984.
Keine Experimente! Vol.II (Weird System Records) transcends the aforementioned compilation trappings, featuring 100 percent “all killer no filler” material exclusive to this comp (well, at the time they were exclusive—some of these songs have appeared on some of the bands’ later discographies). Each band contributes two original songs, one on each side of the LP, covering a wide spectrum of punk sounds. Thus proving that West Germany had some amazing shit going on at that time!
TORPEDO MOSKAU – “Halts Maul”
http://media.blubrry.com/mrrradio/p/maximumrocknroll.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Halts-Maul.mp3
TORPEDO MOSKAU kicks off the party with a solid punk tune with impressive, frantic drumming. Then AGEN 53 maintains the quick pace with great chorus-effected basslines. Next up are the CRETINS who, along with NEUROTIC ARSEHOLES, offer up the best tracks on this LP. TIN CAN ARMY and VOLXFRONT have more of a mid tempo streetpunk approach with great fist pumping shout-alongs, but still showcasing some catchy guitar melodies and world-class hooks. The absurdly named PORNO PATROL picks things up with some excellent catchy hardcore. You may recall them from the essential International Peace 2xLP comp. Then we have “SWAPOland” from NEUROTIC ARSEHOLES, which has such an incredible, melodic, dynamic, and distinct sound. NEUROTIC ARSEHOLES aren’t really matched in sound by anyone, in my opinion — a truly honest and original sounding band, which really comes through in this track and the one that kicks off side B. But not before EA80 and CHAOS Z bring their first contributions to this master slab. The former is one of the (if not the) longest running, important DIY German punk bands. German punks can attest to EA80’s importance in the scene, and staying true to DIY ethics to this day. The last track on side A is a dark, droning, moody punk gem from CHAOS Z, who at this point had begun to evolve from primitive hardcore to a gloomier, somber punk sound (members later formed FLIEHENDE STURME, further exploring and evolving this sound and still doing so today!).
PORNO PATROL – “Reality?”
http://media.blubrry.com/mrrradio/p/maximumrocknroll.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Reality_.mp3
TIN CAN ARMY  – “Dead Born Babies”
http://media.blubrry.com/mrrradio/p/maximumrocknroll.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Dead-Born-Babies.mp3
Side B serves up another dose of the same quality punk, never letting up for a second. Right off the bat is a major standout track, “Alles geht Weiter” by NEUROTIC ARSEHOLES. The bass and guitar eloquently trade off complimentary melodies, almost flirting with one another, as the tuneful vocalist acts as another instrument rather than just “singing words.” Another highlight is “Reality?” by PORNO PATROL, with its crude vocal attack and mid-tempo to fast hardcore switch up. They are the only band to sing in English on this comp, aside from TIN CAN ARMY’s “Dead Born Babies,” which boasts rich bass tone and catchy guitars and growling. The closing track might be my overall favorite. I literally can’t play “Warten Auf…” by CRETINS without wanting to get up and dance around the room, every time, without fail. I have put this song on nearly every mix tape I’ve ever made. It has this brilliant infectious, bouncy, clean guitar line that commands the listener to move their ass. And the chorus is easy to pick up on — it’s just “Cretin…Cretin! – Cretin…Cretin!”
CRETINS – “Warten Auf…”
http://media.blubrry.com/mrrradio/p/maximumrocknroll.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Warten-auf.mp3
I’m pretty sure that there are plenty of copies of this LP out there, especially since Weird System re-released much of their original catalog, so I urge everyone to seek it out! But if you can’t find it, there are plenty of other amazing German punk/hardcore bands not featured on here that I recommend such as SLIME, RAZZIA, NORMAHL, MOTTEK, HOSTAGES OF AYATOLLAH, UPRIGHT CITIZENS, INFERNO, CERESIT, HANS-A-PLAST, BLUTTAT, VORKRIEGSJUGEND, INFERNO, MANIACS, SS ULTRABRUTAL, HONKAS, and TARGETS to name a few.
 More tracks from this comp:
Chaos Z – “Ein Tropfen im Feuer”
 Neurotic Arseholes – “Alles Geht Weiter”
 EA80 – “Sie Werden Nie Verstehen”

By our new record reviewer Matt Badenhop, from MRR #346.
Fuck yes! Lengua Armada brings us yet another reissue of an old Peruvian punk gem! This time it’s a cassette from 1985, remastered from the original tape. LEUZEMIA (aka LEUSEMIA) kicks it off with three catchy, vocal-driven classics, recorded much rawer than their brilliant LP. Next up is ZCUELA CERRADA with four tracks of fuzzy guitars and basic rhythmic hooks. The vocal delivery is really dynamic, and the singer’s voice is always on the verge of cracking, giving it such an adolescent and honest sound. On to side B and we have the pre-ATAQUE FRONTAL band, GUERRILLA URBANA, with five great rudimentary punk blasts. Last but not least is AUTOPSIA, for whom I recall a great 7” reissue was released a couple years ago. AUTOPSIA pushes their sound into hardcore territory with four aggressive ragers with convincing throaty vocals and insanely catchy choruses. All of the material on this LP is consistently raw and primitive and full of hooks and crafty song ideas. There’s also a great foldout insert with lyrics, art, photos, and a really cool testimony, in Spanish and English, on the origin of underground rock in Peru in 1985. Overall this is an amazing glimpse into the early days of the Peruvian punk scene. Get it!

Holeeee shit. This is frenetic punk’n’roll featuring Passy (ex-CONFUSE) very much in the vein of the way later SWANKYS records interpreted the SEX PISTOLS. Puerile, stupid, sex-obsessed punk that you can actually dance to! And not some dumb punk dance like the pogo — I bet you could line dance to this shit. There are so many different instruments, vocalists and styles in the mix here it’s crazy. It sounds like if the WORLD/INFERNO FRIENDSHIP SOCIETY dropped the horns and started shooting for burlesque instead of cabaret? All I know is: fuck me, this is amazing. If there’s a better way to start the year than sitting at MRR listening to “Baby Piss” and drinking a beer at one in the afternoon, I can’t imagine it. I can’t even remember the last band that actually made me laugh out loud (these lyrics have to be heard to be believed). This is essential, and may just be the best thing I’ve ever gotten for review at MRR (at least it’s definitely the most surprisingly amazing!). (Strawberry Records)

Originally intended to be a printed book, this project was put on the back burner for a few years, but now it is finally available to one and all thanks to the wonders of the interweb. The book contains a very impressive collection of flyers from many decades of DIY punk, mostly concentrated on DC bands and the ’80s, but represents a pretty wide variety of genres and regions. No extra info is given with the flyers, leaving you to guess sometimes where or when exactly the show is from. Yet I find that the parts of the story that are left to the imagination can be just as inspiring as the artifacts themselves. And, besides, it’s free and it’s fun — what have you got to complain about?
Willona’s eclectic blog DC Scorpiongirl is worth checking out too. Send her kudos on a job well done while you’re there.

GASH sends shivers down my spine in the same way GISM has the power to do so. It’s visceral, it’s violent, and it feels good. “Power Fucker” is the strongest track out of the GASH tracks. Live, GASH has some bloodshed and vivisection videos that can render some faint hearted watchers uncomfortable. This is a band that pushes limits in the way GISM did, and does it with excellence. Shares members with another solid Boston ripper, ASPECTS OF WAR. The CLEANSING WAVE track is just as strong as their demo earlier this year and still reminds me of MORPHEME with the sickest drumming. This is a beautifully done flexi release that is not just a novelty but a must-own record that captures the raw punk brutality of what is coming out of the Northeast right now. The cut and paste on this flexi still smells of glue. Instructions on flexi say to “play loud and throw away” — punk is meant for destruction and chaos. Get this or don’t. P.S. The blood on my test press had not oxidized when it was received.

White Riot: Punk Rock and the Politics of Race (on Verso Books, edited by Stephen Duncombe and Maxwell Tremblay) just hit the academic circuit claiming to be the “Ultimate Collection” of writings about punk and race. While many, and I mean many, many, many of us punks of color whom this book claims to be representing by way of other peoples voices, disagree, there seems to be very little attention paid to these critiques. I personally plan on responding to the book, but thankfully we have this review in the current issue of MRR. Resulting from many conversations and discussions, Golnar Nikpour, former coordinator, active punk, scholar and, yes, brown as fuck person agreed to review this highly questionable (in my opinion, shitty) book.
—Mariam
The back cover of this recently published volume compiled and edited by NYU professor Stephen Duncombe and New School doctoral student (and frequent MRR book reviewer) Maxwell Tremblay proclaims confidently that White Riot is a “comprehensive” and even “definitive” study of punk’s racial politics; this book, we are told, is “the ultimate collection on punk and race.” Compiling both non-academic and academic writings—i.e., primary material culled from zines and records, and secondary material culled from books and journals on scholarly presses—White Riot attempts to gather and assess the writings of a movement the authors tell us is obsessed with race, but is often unable or unwilling to contend with its own racial contradictions and implications.
Before cracking the book open, I viewed White Riot with both skepticism and anticipation. My skepticism shouldn’t come as any surprise: the academic world has produced a silly number of texts in the name of “punk studies,” but the great majority of these studies traverse a world that has little to do with punk as I know it. At best, they are basically irrelevant the-Sex-Pistols-Were-Totally–Influenced-By-Situationism-and-Other-Serious-Things Studies, and at worst they are egomaniacal attempts to garner legitimacy (not to mention CV padding!) on the backs of DIY subculture(s). In general, I am leery of those academic “experts” whose object of study is punk, not only because I don’t consider the punk scene an intellectual little league that needs legitimacy bequeathed to it by professionals, but also because punk—auto-archiving, self-aware, and interested in its own history—operates on the premise that everyone is an expert. Still, I was hopeful about White Riot, because it promised to showcase writers, records, and ideas that have played a formative role in my own life in punk; I grew up on Los Crudos records and Mimi Nguyen zines, after all. Further, Duncombe and Tremblay were given generous access to the bountiful MRR archive, which I know for a fact could not possibly be used to tell the same old the-Clash-are-the-only-band-that-matters story… or could it?!
Readers of MRR are all likely to recognize that the title of White Riot is borrowed from a Clash song of the same name. Throughout the book, this song—in the form of the notion of punk-as-white riot—is used as a framing tool and constant refrain for the editors in their analysis of punk and race. Punk, we are told by Duncombe and Tremblay, is a quintessentially Anglo/American phenomenon primarily of/by/for disaffected white kids who either consciously or subconsciously (in the form of their anti-establishment posture) believe themselves to have transcended their own racial privilege. Whether they paint themselves as “white negroes” (White Riot starts of with a famous essay by Norman Mailer of that name, implicitly tracing punk’s lineage through American bohemian movements) or as “racetraitors” (the authors remind us of the thusly named—and terrible!—’90s HC band), punks are white (often middle class and suburban) folks anxious about race and their relationship to it. In other words, punk has primarily been a site where alternative models of whiteness—mostly oppositional, sometimes anti-racist, but always constitutively white—have been articulated. With this framing, the central question of whether or not punk can ever be anything other than (just) a white riot guides the editors through their project.
 White Riot is broken into eight contributor-based chapters; the selections have all already been published elsewhere, which means that Duncombe and Tremblay’s efforts are predominantly in curating and introducing each piece. After an opening chapter by the editors (more on that in a sec), we are taken through chapters on the apparent roots of punk (Mailer, the MC5, the Weathermen, etc.), the concept of the “white minority,” aka the just-doesn’t-fit-into-straight-society white rebel (academic articles on the swastika in punk, interviews with Bob Noxious of the Fuck-Ups from MRR, Black Flag from Ripper, etc.), white power and punk (academic articles on skinheads, interviews with Ian Stuart of Skrewdriver from Terminal and Kieran Knutson of Anti-Racist Action from MRR, etc.), and an examination of the relationship between punk, reggae, and anti-racist politics (interviews with Paul Simonon of the Clash, excerpts from cultural critics Jon Savage and Paul Gilroy, early calls for anti-racist politics from Profane Existence, etc.). Incredibly, it is not until the sixth chapter (over 200 pages in!) of this book about race and punk that we hear from any punks of color, as virtually everything compiled up to this point (save a couple of–dare I say token—non-punk people of color, however brilliant, like James Baldwin and Paul Gilroy) is by white punk dudes, white scholar dudes, or the two white editor dudes of this book.
The aforementioned chapter six features an interview with Darryl Jenifer of Bad Brains, more academic articles, interviews with Skeeter Thompson from Scream, late ’70s Pakistani-British punkers Alien Kulture with the BBC, and Los Crudos (from their first year as a band) among others, an excerpt from the Afro-Punk script, some writings about the Taqwacore phenomenon, etc. Chapter Seven examines what the authors term the “Race Riot movement” (though I don’t remember these zines ever being codified as such in their day), with contributions from a number of ’90s zinesters led by a seminal essay by Mimi Nguyen (if you read only one thing from this collection, Mimi’s piece should be it—don’t worry, you can also find it on the internet), as well as essays by Tasha Fierce and Madhu Krishnan and others, an interview with Taina Del Valle of Anti-Product, and an extremely interesting MRR letter exchange jump-started by an writer who goes by “Just Another Nigger.” Finally, in chapter eight we are—at last!—informed that there are, indeed, punk scenes outside of the US/UK, with still more academic articles featuring ethnomusicologists lending their professional expertise in looks at contemporary scenes in Mexico City and Jakarta, Indonesia. This section ends on the piece written by Esneider from Huasipungo for the immigration issue of MRR from a few years back.
The editors’ flawed assumptions about punk’s historical trajectory are clear from their presentation of the material culled. According to White Riot, punk began (and for many years remained only) in London, NYC, and L.A. and as such was founded as a more-or-less a white movement (despite its formative—albeit troubled—relationship to reggae in London), until a political turn in the ’90s that included some punks (Crudos in particular) declaring themselves not only punk but also brown (or black), a shock for the wannabe “colorblind” but nonetheless racially-divided scene. There is then a final movement of punk from London, New York, etc. towards the so-called third world as the popularity of Green Day and the like (I shit you not, this is what this book is telling me) takes punk to such far flung places as Indonesia and Mexico in the ’90s and ’00s. It is in this final move that the authors find the most hope, telling us that if punk is to be not only a white riot, it will be because of the efforts of these non-Anglo punks.
This is a deeply problematic timeline. Most obviously, it is one that utterly excises the essential globality of punk scenes, not to mention the emergence of rock ‘n’ roll as a transnational form long before the advent of punk. This insistence that punk travels from “the West” to “the rest”—a typical imperial trope here espoused by self-proclaimed anti-racists—ironically mirrors and reproduces racist assumptions that “the rest” of the world is living in a belated present, and that their today is not coterminous with “ours” but rather with an era that for “us”—and there is no mistaking who “we” are in this argument—is fully in the rear-view mirror.
Somehow, the editors miss numerous chances to discuss non-Anglo punk scenes even when they’re staring them right in the face. In the introduction, they relay an anecdote about encountering some young Polish punks in front of ABC No Rio in NYC: “Nearby was a group of young punks: leather, spikes, mohawks, heavy black boots, the whole bit…Blink your eyes and it could have been 1977, 1987, or 1997. Except for one thing: these punks all spoke Polish…We stood there wondering what punk meant to them…Punk, with it’s Anglo-American lineage and the dominance of English, must have also been something foreign to them, something alluring, something ‘Other.’” (italics mine, p. 15). These punks are simply assumed to have gotten into punk rock in the US; hence, punk is transformed into something supposedly “foreign” for a bunch of Polish kids at a show. A simple Google search would have revealed the extraordinarily prolific history of Polish punk — a history that has its roots in the late ’70s (hey, just like American and British punk!) and has produced literally thousands of Polish-language bands, records, labels, distros, zines, etc. Instead of a good faith effort at getting to the bottom of this seeming paradox, the navel-gazing and presumption continues: “[Punk], we imagine, was a way to rebel (against their Polish parents) to assimilate (into this new English-speaking world), and rebel once again (against mainstream America). It was a more complicated punk experience than our own.” Um…what? First of all, if the purpose of this study is to unearth the “experience” of punk for members of different communities—immigrant and otherwise—in the US, the authors of this book didn’t have to imagine what was going through the heads of these Polish punks or wonder how they got into punk; they could have just walked up to them and asked! It seems that it is in fact the editors of White Riot who view these Polish punks as hopelessly foreign, rather than the Polish punks’ view of punk rock as such. Of course, this reveals Duncombe and Tremblay’s assumption that their “own experience” of punk—English speaking, suburban, US-based, middle-class, and white—is the norm from which others should be judged.
If the purpose of the study is not to compile and compare “experiences,” however, but rather to provide a geographically contextualized, historically attentive study of how punk scenes are implicated in, produced by, and absorbed into racialized structures of power—and of course they are—White Riot misses the mark. My comments about purpose and context point to a central problem of White Riot. Rather than limit themselves to a study of, say representations of racial difference in the U.S. punk scene in some given era—a topic with which the editors seem as though they would be more comfortable—Duncombe and Tremblay instead boast that they have provided an exhaustive study of (the entirety of the unbounded world of) punk’s relationship to race/ethnicity.
Assuming that such a “definitive” look is even possible—which is frankly doubtful—it is a huge problem that the book doesn’t even seem to know that, as early as the late-’70s, there were fertile punk scenes in any number of major global cities, most of which were not nearly as homogenous as the editors assume. From NYC to London to Warsaw to Tokyo to São Paulo to Istanbul (yes, the first Turkish punk record is from 1977/8!) to Stockholm to Manila, punk as a phenomenon was global from its inception. This is to say nothing of hardcore, which exploded at the tail end of the 1970s—inarguably simultaneously—in tens of countries in the world. Hell, a favorite HC nurd pastime is arguing about whether the first HC band was the Middle Class from California or the SS from Japan or Lixomania from Brazil or…well, you get my point. None of this is to discount the complicated transnational networks—propped up by capitalist relations and implicated in lingering colonial structures of power as they are—in which punk has always operated, and will continue to operate.1 This is the fucked up world in which we live, and I am the last person to romanticize punk as the colorblind utopia (or gender-neutral, or transcendent of class, etc.) some scene participants with their heads in the sand tell themselves that it is. Rather, it is to say that any study of punk must take into account this global-ness—and with it the profoundly different racial/ethnic/class/gender classifications that are at work in any given context (this means, in part, that we cannot afford to only see race in black and white, or only think of race in one way)—particularly if it hopes to understand how something like race or ethnicity is navigated by punks around the world. One cannot simply quote the Clash and be done with it.2
To be fair, the authors do admit that the “claim that punk is just a white riot” is a “dubious” one (213), but they nonetheless replicate this logic over and over (and over and over) throughout the book. From the opening chapter, which promotes the idea that punk is primarily a terrain in which oppositional whiteness is navigated (“Punk offered a space for young Whites growing up in a multicultural world to figure out what it meant to be White”), to the final chapter, which needs the help of professional American (and Canadian) anthropologists and ethnomusicologists (!!!) to tell us about punk scenes in Mexico and Indonesia (apparently these punks do not know how to speak or write for themselves), punk is understood as something that travels from “us” to “them.”
Ironically, some stern admonitions are leveled against other punks/critics who would whitewash punk (one can’t help but recall the old adage about glass houses and casting stones). For instance, despite spending the entire introduction framing punk as (only) a terrain through which to wrestle with whiteness and white identities, Duncombe closes on the claim that “…once punk is indelibly White [as in his book, presumably!] the genuine contributions of Black, Latino, Asian, and other punks of color tend to get erased” (5). Nowhere is this (true!) claim truer than in White Riot. But even the famously white early ’80s USHC scene is not as lily-white as the editors seem to believe. Black Flag, the Germs, the Adolescents, the Fix, Dead Kennedys, Crucifix, Void, Bad Brains, Suicidal Tendencies — almost every single one of the most popular early ’80s USHC bands featured one or more punks of color! This is to say nothing of plenty of lesser known bands, as well as influential zine editors like Tim Tonooka of Ripper, V.Vale of Search & Destroy, and hey even Tim Yohannan, first of three Iranian coordinators of Maximumrocknroll. Most of this history is simply not mentioned by White Riot. Of course, this list is not meant as a tokenizing gesture, a celebration of punk “multiculturalism,” or a diagnosis of a clean bill of racial health for the punk scene. On the contrary, it is just meant to further question Duncombe and Tremblay’s frustrating understanding of punk’s pure “origins” in Anglo whiteness.
Unfortunately—protests to the contrary notwithstanding—Duncome and Tremblay’s project seems to suffer from the impossible and problematic desire for a fully “fixed” and “post-racial” punk that lives up to its promises of offering a subversive whiteness that transcends race, not for the sake of the marginalized punk POC, but for the guilty conscience of the (to borrow from Mimi Nguyen) whitestraightboy punk who has had to wake up to the fact that calling oneself a race traitor doesn’t change one’s ability to access racial privilege, but who would nonetheless like punk to be a scene devoid of racial contradictions. The editors of this volume—who clearly see themselves as the punk norm—first posit punk as quintessentially white (i.e. inauthentic as an oppositional culture after all! damn it, we’ve been duped!), and then practically beg punks of color (here presented as authentic bearers of pure resistance) to somehow absolve this white scene of its dirty racial history. This to me is the ultimate in both the hubris of racial privilege and the uselessness of guilty liberal hand wringing.
—Golnar Nikpour
1 It is perhaps a bit off topic for the main body of this review, and may be too academic for some, but I’d like to propose an alternative way to discuss the emergence of punk in the late ’70s, which could prove more useful for punks in studying and contextualizing punk history. It seems to me that punk—I am speaking here of its late ’70s iteration—is a product of the 20th century movement of capital and peoples, insofar as it is one in a number of cultural (and subcultural) movements that are impossible to imagine without the prior two centuries of global urbanization and proletarianization. Thinking about punk in the context of urban space provides us with new methodological tools and questions, because the emergence of the cosmopolitan capitalist metropolis is a reality of both the colony and the metropole. This could help explain why in 1976-78 we see punk scenes not only in London and New York but also in Istanbul, São Paulo, Tokyo, Mexico City, Stockholm, Warsaw, etc. If there was a punk scene in Istanbul before there was a punk scene in say, suburban Iowa or rural Turkey—and there was, as far as I know—then the movement of ideas is not from “west” to “rest” but rather a product of a particular historical moment in the global city, a moment that is rife with tensions between not only colony and metropole, but also town and country. (This way of thinking also allows us to avoid the elision of class, political economy, gender relationships, etc.)
2One anecdote may help illustrate my point about the importance of context and history. In 2004, Japanese HC sweethearts Framtid—my favorite band in the world—were supposed to travel to the US for a week-long West Coast tour. In the end, they were disallowed from leaving Japan because their drummer Shin—a member of a many generations old Korean-Japanese community that emigrated to Japan from Korea as cheap labor, war refugees, or forcibly conscripted soldiers in the context of Japanese colonial rule of Korea—isn’t allowed Japanese citizenship, despite having been born and raised in Japan. This colonially mitigated relationship to the state that this punk calls home has nothing to do with the racial politics about which the Clash sing. And yet, this legally enforced marker of ethnic difference between one punk and his bandmates couldn’t help but mediate their relationships to punk.

One of the unsettling aspects of the post-internet explosion furthering punk rock’s globalization is that even far-off corners of the world can quickly absorb cultural influences and styles of the broader punk scene of any country, as opposed to developing in isolation with limited influences towards its own direction, leaving everything up for grabs for reinterpretation. The globalization of punk gives a familiarity to the sounds, imagery (the grim reaper riding a skateboard, the universal symbol of punks worldwide), or even band logos to almost any compilation of bands, whether it comes out of the former Soviet Union, Orange County, South America or wherever. Ultimately there’s more positives than negatives to that equation as punk’s cultural, lyrical, musical and artistic message infects the world, emphasized here by the high quality of this 14 band, 26 track compilation from across the two main islands of Aotearoa/New Zealand. Welcome to the Arse-End of the World is the first NZ punk comp in a decade or more, and there’s exceptionally great music throughout: metal-dosed grind by ABORTED CHRISTIANS, blown out Goner Records-style garage noise by TEEN HYGIENE, sludge powerviolence from CRAWLER, throttling blur fastcore from WASTELAND, seriously raging female-vocal hardcore from ROGERNOMIX, more great female vocalled and female powered proto-hardcore from NATURAL GLOW, almost IN/HUMANITY-styled weirdness mixed with screaming thrash from OILBARRONS, lo-fi assault from CASK GRINDERS, which mixes a MAN IS THE BASTARD lumber with scathing, screechy, dual-vocal thrash; metal crossover skate thrash from ELECTRIC MAYHEM, CAUSTIC CHRIST-style straight-up punk from HATEWANX, a throaty vocalled and buzzsaw guitar straight up punk assault from CONNIPTION, solid, crushing metal dirge from METH DRINKER and OPEN TOMB, and snippets of quick thrash from POLICE LINEUP. There’s a sparkling high quality to these bands and despite casting a relatively wide net of sounds and genres, this compilation plays consistently strong and unified throughout as an album itself, which is the mark of a great compilation. It includes a color booklet of mostly artwork and a few lyrics, which largely express the frustration punks feel the world over. The cover features Peter Jackson, the Rainbow Warrior, a kiwi, and, admittedly, probably more than a hundred cultural references and in-jokes I’m missing… Limited to 300 copies…Great, great comp!!

This shouldn’t be a sudden realization to anyone, but every era, generation, and microcosm of punk/hardcore has its benchmark records that define the sound, attitude, and climate of what is going on in the moment. To me it’s records like Young Loud and Snotty, (GI), Jealous Again, Pick Your King, Loud and Clear, Dehumanization, My War, Can’t Close My Eyes, You’re Only Young Once…, Wind of Pain, Severing the Last Barred Window, the TALK IS POISON 7”s — I could go on for a while — that embody this, and I personally consider 1993’s lone 7” from the Bay Area’s JOHN HENRY WEST to be among them. Not only is it one of the best of its time, but one of the best of all-time, so the review gods are a-smiling on me this month.
Much like HEROIN, people like to throw around words like “emo” and “screamo” when referring to JHW, but that shit can be left at the door, ‘cause this is hardcore, plain and simple. Hell, even with its near complete lack of machismo, there are some parts in here that could be described as “hard” by some standard — and I just now noticed some riffs that were definitely copped by another popular Bay Area hardcore band from a few years back, that I won’t name, but in hindsight it makes perfect sense to me. JHW’s songs were usually fast, incredibly driving, dynamic, pissed off, technical, noisy and often chaotic, with great, tuneful chiming guitar melodies similar to Revolution Summer-era DC punk; a great light shining on my ideal sound for youth in the early 1990s.
Front to back, this record is like one guitar flourish, vocal pattern, and stomping intro after another that will no doubt get stuck in your head once these tunes get enough spins to become familiar. The vinyl part of this reish has the 7” on the A side, and the trax from the 3/12/93 and A History of Compassion and Justice 7” comps, plus two unreleased joints (!!!!!) on the flip. The two new ones, “John Henry West” and “Ammunition Aired,” fare perfectly well alongside songs that have been with me for the last eighteen years, and I can’t help but listen to them one-by-one, several times in a row like they are in catch-up mode, before moving on.
To be honest, I only bought this reish for the unreleased stuff, since I already had the rest, but that was before I knew about the accompanying 22-track CD, which has JOHN HENRY WEST’s demo tape, seven live songs from their 50th/last show at Gilman, and nine songs from the band playing a radio sesh at WUSB on Long Island. None of the songs here are exclusive and are all better represented sonically on the releases and non-releases that are on the LP part of this package, but the Gilman set is definitely chock full of that reckless abandon and chaos that one would expect from this band in a live setting (sadly, I never got to see ‘em), and similar can be said for the radio show, which ends with a short interview; all of which I’m stoked to have. I’m normally not one for reissues, but this package got the full glorious treatment that it was due and I can’t recommend it highly enough to those unfamiliar with one of the all time greats, and still worth it for those in the know for the two new tracks alone.

After doing reviewing records for a long time, you start to notice there are very few bands doing something completely original. Or even modestly original. Most bands create music that reflects (at times shamelessly) the music that inspires them. And that’s great, that’s fine. No problem. But every once in a great while you come across a band like SHARKPACT who create music utterly unlike anything you’ve been hearing. And that’s something extraordinary. But this album isn’t just original; it’s also really really fucking good. My attempts to describe the music are going to sound awful, so you’ll have to trust me on this one. The band is just two folks; one on the drums, the other on keyboard, both singing. And what comes out is like a mutant combination of goth and heartfelt pop punk. Wait, wait don’t stop reading, I swear this is awesome! The synthesizer has a late ’80s goth vibe while the drumming has a WARSAW-era JOY DIVISION on meth approach. But then add ONE REASON style vocal harmonies. Heartfelt, urgent, unrelenting. This album is obviously not for everyone, but I’m sold, album of the month, for sure. (Rumbletowne Records)

The Encyclopedia of Doris
Cindy Crabb
Doris Press 
The long awaited Encyclopedia of Doris is here, and it is the so-very-special collection of all of Cindy Crabb’s zines that have come out since the Doris Anthology. If you somehow missed the past decade of Doris, Cindy has been organizing her writing within the framework of letters of the alphabet.  She started doing this with the intention of making it all into one big book in nine years. Each issue covered three letters, and the multiple subjects she assigned to each letter were sometimes the first names of revolutionaries, or of friends of hers that are badass and inspirational; some of the letters go with recipes or herbal treatments, some with times in history or ideas. Sometimes she interprets the letter to fit whatever she wants to talk about, and it always ties in neatly. She conducts interviews, profiles radical discourse, draws cute comic versions of what she is talking about, and shares her take on making a life worth living. Included also are new writings interspersed with interviews other people did with Cindy about playing music, being an anarchist, being a feminist, being a punk over thirty, and more.
The fact that quite a few zine writers are turning into book writers these days presents us with a powerful sense of history. It isn’t just that the audience becomes too big to continue a photocopied print run, though surely once your publication numbers shift from two digit numbers to three, even to four, that means the work is important and affecting. This is history. This is a history book. Sure, it’s the history of one person’s perspective, but it covers such a vast spectrum of the worst things that have ever happened and also the best things, that everyone has something to learn or the chance to identify with the subjects herein. Blogs are all right, but it is important to have this writing all in one tangible place. Having an anthology provides a bigger context than a single issue — also some people never had access to the original zines. It will become a cultural artifact for the future punks or feminist scholars to puzzle over and study, while those who had exposure to the zine from the beginning can reflect on the magnitude of a whole decade going by.
To give you an idea of the incredible breadth of Cindy’s writing, if you indexed Doris you would come up with such a huge interdisciplinary range it would be like trying to throw a net over radical history, survivor support, secrets, health care, feminism, privilege, anarchism, resources, networks, critical thinking about unlearning shitty social conditioning, being in jail, gender, self-help, how-tos, community projects, girl gangs, reaching sobriety, listening…and on and on. Probably my favorite letter in the Encyclopedia is “P.” It covers Prison Abolition, ♥ Punk ♥, the Pitchfork political strategy (five prongs), Power, Primitivism (a conversation with Chris Somerville), and Protection. Under “G,” Cindy covers the immense difficulty of grief, of the loss of a parent, of how hard it is to grieve when everyone is afraid to talk to you about it.
Sometimes I feel Cindy points out the obvious, and it serves as a reminder of how easy it is to lose track of what actually matters. Then I find out she didn’t know what “LOL” means until recently and I want to cry with joy on how refreshing her worldview is. In “Q is for Questions” she had other people ask her questions such as, “How do you discipline yourself to filter out the unimportant stuff and focus on the important?,” which discusses making a five-year plan in order to have goals to reach for that you can be okay with working on slowly. When you are trapped in the mire of day-to-day survival, the sudden revelation that some things just take a long time puts it all into perspective: “So even when I have no motivation and no hope, I just look at my five year plan and try to figure out what the fuck to do next.”
You can’t talk about Doris without acknowledging how significant it is in the world of sexual assault survivor resources. I am certainly not an expert on how much is out there on the subject, but that’s my point. Access! When I was a stumbling teen, confused and damaged and totally alone in my suffering of sexual assault, recovering (or trying to) from an incredibly emotionally abusive relationship, Doris saved my life. I felt isolated and trapped, I didn’t realize I should have been seeking support, and I happened to read about how Cindy was feeling the same thing I was and I realized it wasn’t my fault, I didn’t cause it, and I wasn’t alone. I can’t impart to you how important this writing has been to me, simply talking about the unspeakable, normalizing the experience, and removing the shame associated with having this shit happen to me. For the letter “H” she writes about “Hell.” Not the Hell that is the imaginary fiery place downstairs, but the concept of the worst possible circumstances to be faced with. Discussing sexual abuse and assault is the most difficult part to read, and the most personal. Legions of people have been affected by Cindy’s unique ability to confront the symptoms of abuse in such an inclusive manner, so honest, and unashamed, so as to reveal how awful even the simplest (and sadly, utterly commonplace) manipulation can be, how much it can fuck our lives up. I am just one of how many hundreds or thousands of people who have found strength in her testimony, and hope in her courageous pursuit of the truth.
I feel proud that this anthology exists, that somehow the incredibly healing necessity of writing one’s story can ultimately become a radical resource for so many others, while remaining entirely DIY (that is, self-published and therefore impossible to co-opt or commodify.) While doing a little research for this review I found out that Cindy’s diaries and papers are housed at the Schlesinger Library of the History of Women in America at Radcliffe, Harvard. Doesn’t that mean we are winning?

Slapped in a ultra-crustified cover of skulls, bullets and band photos, this final release from the original line up of Finnish legends RATTUS commemorated their final live appearance in September at Los Angeles’s California Discord Fest, with three new songs that highlight that the band—always experimenting over the course of decades— has never really stopped evolving. Parts surface the melody riffed, guitar-driven hardcore of their classic 1980s records, but fumble a little in their complexity and a modern recording that doesn’t ever seem to pull a cohesive direction to the attack. The bass plunks, the drums hammer, and the vocals have a really uneven delivery. Add in all the different influences—from modern metal to classic ’77 style moves—and it’s just slightly off and sort of just rambles and stews. But you know what? RATTUS were fan-fucking-tastic in LA, and are still one of the world’s greatest punk bands. Ever. So I’ll keep spinning this—like any of their diehard fans—to try to glean their inspiration. Lyrics are Finnish with no translation. On the flip, Riverside, CA’s HOLOKAUST delivers three solid, meaty standard issue DISCHARGE blasts. These tracks distinguish themselves in the basic, wadded up crunch that the guitars get in their semi-lo-fi recording—a recording akin to the happy accidents of ’90s crust records, as opposed to a current intentionally lo-fi noise fest. The drums sturdily roll around this thick, dumpy chunk of simple riffs, as the vocals blast standard issue punk declarations over the din “Brainwashed into Submission!” “Waves of Fire! Mushroom cloud! Incinerated!” making for a familiarly satisfying, two fingers in the air, dose of good punk rock fun. (Rotten To The Core Records)

ROYAL HEADACHE, another in an endless stream of fantastic new Australian groups, delivers an essentially flawless pop record in long form on their first shot. While their debut single totally impressed, they truly shine here, making the kind of record that folks from a wide array of genres will likely embrace. The performances are top notch across the board, complete with actual singing that’s so proficient and downright awesome that it sounds totally fucking jarring. The production is perfect, fuzzy in all the right places, propelled by a stabbing guitar sound that recalls the most powerful moments of classic UK DIY punk rock. The soulfulness and excellent songwriting exhibited throughout brings to mind a speedy, punk SQUEEZE, which I hate myself for saying, but fuck it, it’s there. Much like stateside heroes HOME BLITZ, ROYAL HEADACHE is capable of conjuring up a monster hook out of chaos and making a whole lot of other current pop bands sound terrible in the process.

STAR FUCKING HIPSTERS – From the Dumpster to the Grave LP
Let the punk police come and take me away, let them strap me into a straightjacket and gag me on the way out the door, but I will still say that this record is fukkn great. I know it’s been long out of vogue to like ska punk, and NOFX has been passé for even longer, but my facial hair has been out of vogue for longer than most taste makers have had a turntable, so fuck ‘em. I mention NOFX not just because Fat Wreck is responsible for this release, but because STAR FUCKING HIPSTERS have taken the ska/punk hybrid that frontman Sturgeon perfected with his previous bands CHOKING VICTIM and LEFTOVER CRACK and injected into it the high energy ultra catchy hardcore punk that Fat Mike has been slinging for a couple of decades. It works. Rarely do the hours poured into a record make them so evident as they do on this release, but when From the Dumpster veers off on over instrumentalized tangents it never seems trite—it just seems right. This record is nothing if not sincere, and every musical excursion is obviously a path taken by true fans that have become masters at their craft. Brilliant vocal trade-offs dominate many songs, with Nico’s vocals taking a confident lead, and the occasional (but dominant) ska parts are accented by subtly sparse and brilliant keys and horns. If you want cred, then check out this (partial) list of band members and contributors: DEGENERICS, ERGS, NEUROSIS, the COUP, GR’UPS, CONQUEST FOR DEATH, DYSTOPIA, DEADFALL, SOVIETTES…you still need more? Well, then no list would win you over anyway. This is excellent… you might not like it, that decision is purely yours. But awesomeness is a fact. (Fat Wreck Chords)

DEATHCAGE – Plague of the Rats LP
Hot damn, hooked from the first song. I very much enjoyed the DEATHCAGE EPs, and this is more of the same incredibly epic, fist-pumping Japanese hardcore-meets-epic metal a la the almighty DEATH SIDE. Every fucking song on this platter, even the lesser ones, has a part that cries out for the horns or a bit of air guitar. Sure it’s derivative — so fucking what? The more important point is that it’s fucking great! Got a metal friend who thinks punk is all untalented noise? Put this bastard on and laugh right in his fucking face. Everything on here, from the phenomenal leads to the brutal just-this-side-of-metal drumming to the massive gang choruses is so fucking on point it’s ridiculous. By all rights this should be appearing on a number of “best of the year” lists. Flat out fucking awesome. (Agipunk)

DEPHOSPHORUS – Axiom LP
I absolutely love when I get a record to review, have never heard of the band yet within seconds of dropping the needle I’m floored and headbanging. DEPHOSPHORUS are onto something here. DEPHOSPHORUS is a three piece from Greece. Their sound is unique in that it is somewhat a mix of the older German metalcore sound and grindcore but with some electronics added. Every track sounds huge. It’s hard to believe this is just three people. “Collimator” could be a heavier BURIAL YEAR. “Continuum” has a slight metal leaning. “Dephosphorus” has more melodic guitars, has slower moments and more obvious electronics. The album has a cosmic or space and time theme throughout the lyrics. Wow. (7DegreesRecords)

BIG EYES falls somewhere between the MUFFS and the REPLACEMENTS, with really cool, tough girl vocals and of course there’s an invocation of the RAMONES. The sound on this LP is incredible, almost too perfect; it sounds like what you want the cool girl band to sound like in ’80s subculture movies, but they always end up with some shitty synth puffpastries. This is tough punk rock. City street rock, the sound of trash strewn sidewalks, dogs tied up to chain link fences, feathered hair with leather jackets, a packet of Lucky Strikes and beat up Chucks. It’s totally the more rock end of punk, and it’s so easy to go into really gross territory when you are in those waters — you know, shitty rawkin’ Sunset Strip bar rock cheese chowder. This is somehow badass though. The band is so tight and the songs are so cohesive and tough sounding, hooks in all the right places, melancholy and mean rather than posturing and limp. So catchy it’s relentless! I feel so cheesy writing this review, but it’s the band you wish the girl from Freaks and Geeks had formed after watching that terrible CREAM cover band her friends were in. Kate’s voice is sick, somewhere between Joan Jett, Kim Shattuck and Paula Pierce… She invokes Joey Ramone and that’s just dreamy. Anyway, I was not expecting to like this record at all, but I am convinced! (Don Giovanni Records)

So stoked to see a full length from this Peruvian punk band, who I first noticed on the BRUTALES MATANZAS compilation also on the Cintas Pepe label. The first track reminds me of my favorite song by SORELLA MALDESTRA with the robotic effect filtered vocals at the beginning. This the sound of really early punk with some slightly fuzzed out basic guitar leads and mid tempo drumming and a bass that follows the drums building a solid rhythm section. The songs are reminiscent of a lot of REVOLUCION X, specifically in the vocals and in the sentiment of “I’m Making My Future With the Border Patrol,” but not in speed or the “tuca-tuca” drums of the aforementioned band. This band argues that good punk is really good rock’n’roll, and any track on here could be on the Solo Para Punks comp from Mexico on Cobra discos — I mean in quality, sound, lyrics, song structure… In other words, this sounds like old punk, more informed by los SAICOS than LEUSEMIA as far as Peruvian comparisons, yet still very original. The lyrics are snotty, pissed and political, in a funny “fuck you” and rudimentary way. MORBO is obnoxious and fresh while still being able to harness the spirit of creativity, regardless of skill, that old punk is so amazing for. So fucking good, pretty crazy, and totally fucking punk. Primordial punk… If you don’t get it, you are a chump. (Cintas Pepe)

MRR HQ is located in San Francisco a few blocks from where the Saint John Coltrane African Orthodox Church used to be located—a church that was centered around an explosion of spirituality and free jazz. While John Coltrane’s avantgarde cutting edge has dulled with the recognition of his more traditional material as breakthrough classics of the genre, leading to mainstream acceptance, his experimental free jazz period is something that still remains challenging. It’s as much about Coltrane’s movement through the experimentation as a listening experience, it seems to never necessarily arrive at its destination, which is kind of the point. Chilean hardcore band CONTRA TODOS MIS MIEDOS (“Against All My Fears”) features a cropped close up of Coltrane’s image from the Blue Train LP on the cover, and while the music is stellar QUICKSAND/ REFUSED styled hardcore—and worthy of checking out alone if those points of reference prick your ears—it solidly delivers a relatively stable set of ideas. The relation to the core of ideas of Coltrane that warrants appropriating his image for the cover isn’t really evident. The title of the EP translates to rage, and while Coltrane’s music was moody, anger was never really the core of its impact in the same way you think of anger being a central focus of punk music. Coltrane died in 1967, nine or ten years before the punk explosion of the ’70s, and at the nascent steps of Michigan ’60s punk like the STOOGES and MC5, that at their most experimental were taking influence from the expansion of music simultaneously being forwarded by free jazz. The relation to hardcore might simply that this type of posi-hardcore that’s reaching for a broader meaning is also reaching to find that deeper, spiritual core beyond just existing as a pure musical experience. I can only infer that with no translations in English for the band’s lyrics or to the lengthy notes on the sleeve aside from a footnote to Karl Marx (!)—the one diatribe in English in the recording is near nonsensical. This EP is however, an impressive marked jump in delivery, playing and recording values from their 2008 XXVII LP. The guitars are free to jump around, crush and solo wildly on the flange, while segmented, crunching, lumbering break downs and harsh shouted vocals give the EP an intensity like the best of the ’90s bands of this style. Weighed on one scale it’s a quite experimental deviation from the one-two-three punk rock, but in tacking itself to one of the creative geniuses of modern music, I kept waiting for it jump off the deep end like Ascension or Om… Go for it you wild Chileans!!!! Bring out the harp, chimes and alto sax and combine that with QUICKSAND and FARSIDE!!! Overall good EP, limited to 560 copies. (Amendment Records)

What can really be said about this wild bunch? First off, I think that people who say ISTERISMO sounds like WRETCHED, or DECLINO, or IMPACT, etc., are just confused or have never heard those bands. Maybe there are some lifted riffs hidden in there, but if you can point me to someone that can pick any riffs out of this fuzz, I’ll eat my hat. (Not really, I actually don’t care one bit, so…) Yes, they are fast, and yes, they sing in Italian, but these noisy Japanese punkers have a sound all their own. Bottom line is that this band plays awesome raw hardcore that fits in with the whole blown-out, violent, roaring sounds that the shoelace-headband set of neo-hipster noise crusters are all aflutter over these last few years. Not that there’s anything wrong with that, because this scene (in Japan especially) has produced some of my favorite wild hardcore records in recent years, and the ISTERISMO EP Non Puo Sopprimere il Mio Conflitto—which is collected on this here LP—is one of them. This discography LP, also contains their trax from the Deny the Report vol. 5 CD, Yotsuva, and Hardcore Inferno comps, their first demo, split tape with TERROR, and a live cassette. There’s a lot of music here and very little variation, so if hissing feedback, screaming maniacs, and unrefined walls of noise hurdling at you at 100 miles per hour isn’t your thing, steer clear, but for me it’s bliss.

The Chicago straightedge nails it again. I missed out on their demo so I can’t make a comparison, but RAZORXFADE sounds like they’ve simply listened to all subgenres of top-shelf hardcore for years, and applied this to their songwriting and musical aesthetic with expertise. When I can hear identifiable elements of Boston Not L.A.-era GANG GREEN, INFEST, SSD, and YOUTH OF TODAY flawlessly worked into a number of songs that still sounds like the band’s own creations, I know that they’re on to something that’s more than enough to forgive their stupid name. Most of these songs go in unpredictable directions and will speed up or go into a mosh breakdown on a dime, yet the band is good enough at writing good songs and original riffs that there’s no forced or herky-jerky anything to get in the way. All of this is backed by vocals that are, um, boiling over with spite and possibly spit, and in the red of the already abrasive recording that makes it fitting that this was put out by a member of RAW NERVE. Along with DURESS, POISON PLANET, NOOSE, and A SORRY EXCUSE, this band can be added to the list of Midwest bands that are redefining straight edge hardcore to mean something raw, raging, and with substance, no pun intended. (Not Normal)
